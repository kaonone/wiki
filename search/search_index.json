With that in mind, Akropolis has built AkropolisOS, light and modular framework for creating for-profit DAOs, with customisable user incentives, automated liquidity provision enabled by the bonding curve mechanism, and programmatic liquidity and treasury management. Our first product, Sparta, allows taking undercollateralized loans (borrower provides only 50% of collateral), as well as to passively generate yield via integrated yield rebalancer to get maximum available APR from different DeFi protocols. All funds are pooled, and the internal economy is based on a bonding curve, which provides additional incentives to the users.

Call LoanModule.repay(debt, lAmount) to execute operation. Distributions When borrower repays some part of his loan, he uses some PTK (either from his balance or minted when he sends DAI to the pool). This PTKs are distributed to supporters, proportionally to the part of the loan they covered. The borrower himself also covered half of the loan, and his part is distributed over the whole pool. All users of the pool receive part of this distributions proportional to the amount of PTK they hold on their balance and in loan proposals, PTK locked as collateral for loans is not counted. Distribution mechanics When you need to distribute some amount of tokens over all token holders one's first straight-forward idea might be to iterate through all token holders, check their balance and increase it by their part of the distribution. Unfortunately, this approach can hardly be used in Ethereum blockchain. All operations in EVM cost some gas. If we have a lot of token holders, gas cost for iteration through all may be higher than a gas limit for transaction (which is currently equal to gas limit for block). Instead, during distribution we just store amount of PTK to be distributed and current amount of all PTK qualified for distribution. And user balance is only updated by separate request or when it is going to be changed by transfer, mint or burn. During this \"lazy\" update we go through all distributions occured between previous and current update. Now, one may ask what if there is too much distributions occurred in the pool between this updated and the gas usage to iterate through all of them is too high again? Obvious solution would be to allow split such transaction to several smaller ones, and we've implemented this approach. But we also decided to aggregate all distributions during a day. This way we can protect ourself from dust attacks, when somebody may do a lot of small repays which cause a lot of small distributions. When a distribution request is received by PToken we check if it's time to actually create new distribution. If it's not, we just add distribution amount to the accumulator. When time comes (and this condition is also checked by transfers, mints and burns), actual distribution is created using accumulated amount of PTK and total supply of qualified PTK.","title":"AkropolisOS"},{"location":"akropolisOS/#akropolisos","text":"AkropolisOS is A Solidity framework for building complex dApps and protocols (savings, pensions, loans, investments).

You can attract additional liquidity without using a 150% ensuring in digital assets by trading C2FC. How does it work An already operating business or an individual who has regular income payments, that needs additional liquidity at the moment can issue C2FC for defined future periods and trade them at marketplace. It looks like exchanging future cashflows for \"money now\" by selling discounted C2FC or borrowing funds, using C2FC as collateral. Are there any risks involved in issuing or trading C2FCs? C2FC issuance itself does not provide any risks until it is involved in the open market. When it is exchanged to other unit of value and changed ownership, there is a risk that future cashflow would be lower than estimated or there would no money arrived at all.

Delphi is a DeFi yield farming aggregator and Dollar Cost Averaging tool that offers synthetic savings and high yield \u201caccounts\u201d aimed at DeFi-curious users with no deep technical knowledge and some understanding of Ethereum and crypto. Delphi was built by the Akropolis team and is the second product built on AkropolisOS. Why Delphi? Today, the DeFi area provides great opportunities for earning money through staking, yield farming and liquidity provision. Nowadays, different DeFi protocols offer various opportunities for yield generation & yield farming which might confuse DeFi newbies & people who do not have time to follow the news constantly. Delphi allocate different yield-farming & yield-generating pools in one interface, solving an important problem for novice DeFi users - simple & user-friendly interface with concise and understandable information. Another important feature is the ability to set an automated dollar-cost average (DCA) strategy into assets/liquidity pools - oriented at users who want to set up a long-term portfolio. Delphi decreases operational costs for such operations as all funds are pooled. We also gave special attention to UI/UX design trying to make it simple & understandable for the end-users (novice or experts) - and are going to constantly improve it & add more user-friendly features as we progress based on feedback and best practices in the space. How does it work? Connect your wallet. Choose one or several pools that currently provides the best yield farming opportunities. Choose if you want to deposit all available funds or Dollar Cost Averaging into those pools. Relax. I see a lot of \u201ccoming soon\u201d in the interface. What is the roadmap? You can find the roadmap here . We\u2019re following Guarded Launch approach proposed by Ken Deeter from Electric.Capital - and will be rolling out updates to both interface and functionality after thorough testing and audits. Save Savings is all about stablecoins pools. Currently, you can choose where to supply liquidity from selected Curve.fi and Compound pools. You can allocate in one or several pools in once click - just choose amounts & currencies, click on Allocate & chill - your funds will be sent to the corresponding pools, earn interest & farm different tokens all at once. Invest Investments tab is similar to savings with one big difference - all pools contain volatile assets, so risks connected to impermanent loss are much higher. Just choose the pool you\u2019re willing to supply liquidity to & confirm deposit - chill while your funds earning interest & farming different tokens all at once. DCA Dollar-cost average is a popular strategy in traditional finance and crypto community. If put it simply - it is automated, periodic purchases of an asset (commonly referred to as \u201cstacking sats\u201d in BTC community). Regardless of the asset, the DCA strategy has always been to invest periodically (weekly, monthly, etc) in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the price and at regular intervals. DCA effectively removes much of the headache that comes with attempts to time the market in order to buy an asset at the best prices. How to set up DCA? DCA pools are the same investment pools with volatile assets. The logic works differently though: All deposits are in USDC Insert overall deposit amount & amount for weekly DCA, confirm deposit Your deposit is sent to the savings pool (Compound USDC) where it constantly earns interest On a weekly basis, your weekly DCA amount is withdrawn from the savings pool and sent to the exchange to buy the asset of your choice (BTC, ETH) or directly to the liquidity pool. Assets bought through DCA are sent to the corresponding investment pool, where they earn interest. Important! DCA are non-stablecoin pools. Higher risk-reward pools with higher volatility \u2014 higher potential capital gains and losses. Useful links: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp http://dcabtc.com/ Stake Currently, stake tab has only one pool - AKRO staking. Mechanics here are simple - you just send AKRO to this pool & farm AKRO&ADEL. No lock-up. We will be expanding the mechanics in the coming days, as well as adding governance pools to this tab. Delphi Functionality How to allocate liquidity? Enable Allocate switcher to choose pools you want to deposit into Choose amount & tokens in each pool Click on Allocate button to deposit in one transaction (additional transactions may come in a form of \u201capprove spending\u201d) That\u2019s it. Your funds are sent to corresponding pools where they earn yield & farm tokens. Important! Currently, \u201cAllocate in one transaction\u201d is possible only if you deposit the same asset in all pools. We will be expanding this functionality in the coming weeks. For DCA deposits, please see How to set up DCA . What's \"Add all coins in a balanced proportion\"? Each liquidity pool has a balanced ratio for assets within it - by depositing tokens in a balanced proportion, you decrease the chance of swap (leading to fewer gas fees & swap fees). What's \"Infinite unlock\"? Infinite unlock means that you preapprove the contract to be able to spend any amount of tokens when you interact with it. Enabling infinite unlock means that you approve spending tokens only once (thus reducing gas costs associated with signing \u201capprove\u201d transaction). Bear in mind - after enabling infinite unlock, all following transfers/deposit of the asset chosen won\u2019t need approval - so please use it if you fully trust the contract. How to withdraw liquidity I provided? Each strategy option in Delphi has a withdrawal tab. You can withdraw either in a proportion of pool assets (preferred way as it decreases swap fees) or in a form of individual tokens (with swaps & fees in place).

The proposed system enables automatic updates and resource management for running nodes, additionally providing templates for launching parachains. Github Repo What is PolkaHub? Polkahub is a fast, scalable blockchain infrastructure component for Substrate parachains. Polkahub provides parachain developers with the ability to launch and manage network infrastructure using our command line utility and the ability to provide public node access. Polkahub provides developers with a unified standard for packaging and deploying applications to cloud infrastructure. Polkahub provides the functionality to track and control the parachain\u2019s versions. So in the event of critical bugs arising, developers can update or roll back the version of the parachain using simple commands (via running specific commands in a command line). Polkahub supports Substrate node deployment to remote servers or cloud infrastructure via git. Polkahub infrastructure is based on Docker Container Services such as Kubernetes. Docker provides high-level interfaces for isolated environments within the node's execution. Easily scaled, managed and updated. No need to rely on DevOps and System Administration for managing parachain\u2019s infrastructure - thanks to PolkaHub. You only need git, command line and a simple web-interface. Quick Start Install CLI MacOS / Linux You can just use bash script: $ bash <(curl http://get.polkahub.org/ -L) This will install polkahub binary in your /usr/local/bin(MacOS) or /usr/bin(Linux) directory Then you can use it: $ polkahub <action> [ARGS] Or use docker image like this: $ mkdir $HOME/.polkahub $ docker run --rm -ti -v $HOME/.polkahub_docker:/tmp/home -e POLKAHUB_HOME=/tmp/home registry.polkahub.org/polkahub-cli:v3 <action> [ARGS] Usage CLI Authentication $ polkahub auth Email: user@example.com Password: Login user with email user@example.com \u2802\u2802\u2802 done Use email and password created via https://polkahub.org or create new email and password via CLI (see Registration section) Registration $ polkahub register Email: user@example.com Password: Confirm Password: Registration new user with email user@example.com \u2840\u2840\u2840 done Create a new project $ polkahub create akropolisos \u2801\u2801\u2801 done https -> \"https://steadfast-surprise-6647-akropolisos-rpc.polkahub.tech\" ws -> \"wss://steadfast-surprise-6647-akropolisos.polkahub.tech\" remote -> \"https://git.polkahub.org/steadfast-surprise-6647-akropolisos.git\" Then you can add remote to your project, push it and it will automatically start CI build.

Our pool automates the work of financial organizations, and solves the following challenges: Risk assessment of different investment instruments Lending funds with the maximum percentage, taking loss risk into account Liquidity provision to avoid cash gap and subsequent bankruptcy The goal of our pool is to create a community-owned fund that helps its members earn high-interest rates by providing unsecured loans to its members and by providing capital to various liquid DeFi instruments.

Automates \"ragequitting\" in case of disagreements with decisions made in the pool. Definitions and principles Initial deposits only in DAI. Akropolis Sparta Pool Token (ASPT) \u2013 ERC20 token of DAO. Gives the right to vote for governance/investment decision and to get uncollateralized loan. Ragequit - immediate pool leaving mechanism without funds blocked in DAO (in case you haven't staked (voted for) anyone). Bonding curve \u2013 mathematical curve defining price/supply correlation. How does it work? Entering and leaving the pool A DAO is a community-owned organization where community members collectively made decisions regarding fund management. This can scare people away from entering or leaving the DAO as their funds may be blocked in the DAO, for one reason or another. To solve this problem, we use the Continuous Token Model. Users can enter and exit the DAO by buying and selling ASPTs price of which is determined by the bonding curve (mathematical curve defining price/supply correlation). This approach not only solves the problem of potential funds lock but also gives an additional incentive for the first users due to the bonding curve design. The cost of the token on the bonding curve depends on the amount of liquidity in the pool: with increasing liquidity, the cost of the DAO token increases, while lesser liquidity decreases it. However, exiting the DAO using the bonding curve exposes the liquidity problem - what if someone wants to exit the pool with no liquidity? (for example, all liquid assets are distributed to borrowers). In our case, such a situation is impossible due to the design of the pool. \"Ragequit\" is a mechanism for leaving the pool at any moment, if you haven't staked (voted to give a loan) for somebody. MolochDAO was first to introduce this approach. We implemented our own variation of \"ragequit\" using the Bonding Curve mechanism. More on it in \"Bonding curve section\" \u0421redit issuance One of the main use cases of our product is attracting unsecured (uncollateralized) credit by pool users. Why the creation of such a product is so important to us? In developing countries, unsecured credit is often considered as the only tool to improve life quality (see Grameen Bank, Chamas, etc.), because people there don't have access to the proper banking system. At the same time, most existing DeFi products offer over-collateralized lending that attracts only specific users - either traders who want more leverage for trading or holders who believe in asset growth but need DAI to pay for current expenses. Our focus is on building financial products for underbanked people, who are not knowledgeable on the crypto market. But how can we guarantee the system stability and decrease to a minimum possibility of lending funds to unreliable borrowers (which will lead to the cash gap in the pool)? We decided to use a social reputation system to solve this issue. Moreover, at the current level of development of decentralized services, we do not believe in opportunistic attempts to create a \"single rating / scoring\" for all users. We have chosen to use a simpler approach in our product, which we call \"Community grant\" - all platform loans must be 100% secured. In addition to the user's deposit, other members of the pool can vouch for it. How it works: The user pledges his ASPTs as collateral (the deposit should be no less than 50% of the loan amount, i.e. the user will not be able to take a loan more than 200% relative to the size of ASPTs that he has) Pool members who consider the user to be a good borrower vouch for him and lock their ASPTs as collateral. If the sum of ASPTs locked (both borrower and pool members) equals to the size of the loan than the borrower receives a loan in DAI. This design leads to two main questions: How to encourage pool members to be active and vouch for potential borrowers? How to assess the borrower's risks in case of pseudo-anonymization used in Ethereum, when you know only the wallet address, but not the personal data of a person? We assume that the guarantors from the pool will know the borrower. For example, a small community of 20-30 people who trust each other and will use our platform to provide loans to each other. Interest rate share When repaying a loan in DAI, the borrower also pays interest on his loan. 50% of the interest remains in the pool, while the remaining 50% is equally distributed in the form of ASPTs between the users who vouched for the borrower, depending on their stake. The interest rate is paid by the borrower in the form of ASPT (DAI received from the borrower is used to purchase ASPT and distribute it among the guarantors). ASPTs burning If the borrower delays the repayment of the loan and does not repay (in full or in part) within the specified period: ASPTs are burned in proportion to the interest rate. If the user has X delays (for example, 6 - the governed parameter), then all ASPTs are burned In such case, ASPT supply, price, and pool liquidity decrease. ASPT role Acts as collateral for loan issuance Used to distribute interest earned after right risk assessment and repayment of the loan by borrower Right to act as a guarantor for the loan Spreads between enter and exit price of ASPT (pool earnings) used for AKRO buyback from the market and further use in the Development Fund. Bonding Curve Mechanics Bonding Curve has two prices - the purchase price and the sale price. Bonding curve uses the formula x = f(S) , where x is the number of issued tokens, and S is the pool size. There is a spread 'd' between the purchase price and the sale price, - the fee for exiting the pool. Upon entering the pool, the price is formed as follows: where A is the volume of total assets (liquid assets in Pool + debt commitments), Deposit is the size of the deposit, dx is the number of ASPTs tokens received. When you exit the pool, the price is formed as follows: Or (the same) , where L is the volume of liquid assets, x = f(L) . The sum forms the pool earnings - spread between enter and exit price of ASPT, amount of money user gets. To calculate f(S) we propose to use the following formula Preventing attacks on the pool Let's suppose there are x funds in the pool and f(x) liquid tokens accordingly. Let's also suppose a fraudster wants to take a loan m , . The fraudster has accomplices with the amount of funds P . To process the attack, the accomplices pre-enter the pool, which in turn increases the cost of ASPTs, then vote for the fraudster and he gets a loan. After that, the fraudster accomplices leave the pool. If no one spots it , they will be able to repeat such a scheme over and over again, leading to pool bankrupcy. Let's check under which conditions would this be possible: Accomplices enter the pool, buying G = f(x + P) - f(x) tokens for the amount of funds P , where f(x + P) stands for liquid tokens in the pool. Pool liquidity increases and has x + P liquidity. Fraudster gets a loan m . To do this, he and his accomplices lock Q = f(x + p)-f(x + p - m) tokens, whereas f(x + p - m) is liquid tokens in the pool and x + p - m is the pool liquidity. Fraudster accomplices own G - Q liquid ASPTs. They take them out and get H = x + P - m - f^{-1}[f(x + p - m)- G + Q] for them. As a result, the fraudster and his accomplices have m + H funds. If m + H vs P , then the fraudsters made money: As f is an increasing function, the sign will be equivalent to the Let's add G and Q values: Based on the above, vs is equivalent to '=' . P sign does not matter in this case ( P could be positive and could be negative which is equivalent that accomplices leave pool first, and then join again). Q.E.D., cooperation with fake pool members will not give any advantage to the fraudster. Ragequit mechanics: A. Let's suppose that there are L1 liquid assets in the pool and f(L1) tokens accordingly. The pool has not issued any loans yet. B. Next, let's imagine the following situation - the dL1 liquidity was added to the pool and tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1) - f(L1) were issued. C. Next, the pool issued a loan in the amount of dL1 . All issued tokens are now locked and L1 liquid assets and f(L1) liquid tokens remain in the pool. If the loan was not repaid, then all the locked tokens got burned. After this, participants with liquid tokens will be able to exit, as there is f(L1) tokens and L1 liquidity. If the loan was repaid and during this time no one entered the pool, then we return to the situation B and everyone will be able to leave the pool. If more people entered the pool, and the loan has not yet been returned: let's assume that dL2 liquidity was added to the pool and contributors received the tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2) - f(L1 + dL1) . The pool has liquid assets in the amount of L1 + dL2 , and liquid tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2)-f(L1 + dL1) + f(L1) . Let's assume all participants want to leave the pool. They will be able to do so due to the bonding curve design: f\u2019\u2019(L1)dL1dL2 < 0 is true because of f\u2019\u2019<0 . Let's now assume that loan has been returned. All locked tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1) - f(L1) will be unlocked. The pool will now have liquid assets in the amount of L1 + dL1 + dL2 , and liquid tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2) . They will be able to do so due to the bonding curve design. This logic can be generalized to an arbitrary number of credits / affiliations in the DAO. AKRO Governance Our management system is similar in its principles to the MakerDAO governance. By purchasing and staking AKRO pool tokens, the user can participate in the system governance - vote for changes in bonding curve parameters, collateralization level, buyback parameters, etc. It can be done only by AKRO holders (and not ASPTs holders) to prevent pool members from abusing their power (e.g. entering the pool, change bonding curve and make ASPTs too expensive to enter the pool for future members). Roles on the platform Economic Objectives How does token help? Borrower Have access to an unsecured creditHave a regular availability of credit The token issued equivalently to the amount of DAI allows you to leave a request for an unsecured loan in the pool and collateralize a loan. The user can get a 200% loan of the amount of ASPT available.Also, high liquidity in the pool formed by depositing funds, using a token, attracting users according to the bonding curve, implies the constant presence of a \"living\" asset available for a loan. Thus, the user has access to an unsecured loan. Liquidity provider To grant loans with the best risk/profit ratio Providing capital in ASPT, the provider can stake for the requests of borrowers, receiving a percentage of interest. Also, since the governance is working by voting in ASPT, its holding allows participating in collective voting for various decisions, for example, changing the interest rate or bonding curve parameters.","title":"Sparta"},{"location":"sparta/#what-is-the-sparta-pool","text":"Our pool automates the work of financial organizations, and solves the following challenges: Risk assessment of different investment instruments Lending funds with the maximum percentage, taking loss risk into account Liquidity provision to avoid cash gap and subsequent bankruptcy The goal of our pool is to create a community-owned fund that helps its members earn high-interest rates by providing unsecured loans to its members and by providing capital to various liquid DeFi instruments.","title":"What is the Sparta Pool?"},{"location":"sparta/#motivation-objective-features","text":"Uncollateralised lending available through the pooling of funds.

Let's check under which conditions would this be possible: Accomplices enter the pool, buying G = f(x + P) - f(x) tokens for the amount of funds P , where f(x + P) stands for liquid tokens in the pool. Pool liquidity increases and has x + P liquidity. Fraudster gets a loan m . To do this, he and his accomplices lock Q = f(x + p)-f(x + p - m) tokens, whereas f(x + p - m) is liquid tokens in the pool and x + p - m is the pool liquidity. Fraudster accomplices own G - Q liquid ASPTs. They take them out and get H = x + P - m - f^{-1}[f(x + p - m)- G + Q] for them. As a result, the fraudster and his accomplices have m + H funds. If m + H vs P , then the fraudsters made money: As f is an increasing function, the sign will be equivalent to the Let's add G and Q values: Based on the above, vs is equivalent to '=' . P sign does not matter in this case ( P could be positive and could be negative which is equivalent that accomplices leave pool first, and then join again). Q.E.D., cooperation with fake pool members will not give any advantage to the fraudster.","title":"Preventing attacks on the pool"},{"location":"sparta/#ragequit-mechanics","text":"A. Let's suppose that there are L1 liquid assets in the pool and f(L1) tokens accordingly. The pool has not issued any loans yet. B. Next, let's imagine the following situation - the dL1 liquidity was added to the pool and tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1) - f(L1) were issued. C. Next, the pool issued a loan in the amount of dL1 . All issued tokens are now locked and L1 liquid assets and f(L1) liquid tokens remain in the pool. If the loan was not repaid, then all the locked tokens got burned. After this, participants with liquid tokens will be able to exit, as there is f(L1) tokens and L1 liquidity. If the loan was repaid and during this time no one entered the pool, then we return to the situation B and everyone will be able to leave the pool. If more people entered the pool, and the loan has not yet been returned: let's assume that dL2 liquidity was added to the pool and contributors received the tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2) - f(L1 + dL1) . The pool has liquid assets in the amount of L1 + dL2 , and liquid tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2)-f(L1 + dL1) + f(L1) . Let's assume all participants want to leave the pool. They will be able to do so due to the bonding curve design: f\u2019\u2019(L1)dL1dL2 < 0 is true because of f\u2019\u2019<0 . Let's now assume that loan has been returned. All locked tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1) - f(L1) will be unlocked. The pool will now have liquid assets in the amount of L1 + dL1 + dL2 , and liquid tokens in the amount of f(L1 + dL1 + dL2) . They will be able to do so due to the bonding curve design. This logic can be generalized to an arbitrary number of credits / affiliations in the DAO.","title":"Ragequit mechanics:"},{"location":"sparta/#akro-governance","text":"Our management system is similar in its principles to the MakerDAO governance. By purchasing and staking AKRO pool tokens, the user can participate in the system governance - vote for changes in bonding curve parameters, collateralization level, buyback parameters, etc. It can be done only by AKRO holders (and not ASPTs holders) to prevent pool members from abusing their power (e.g. entering the pool, change bonding curve and make ASPTs too expensive to enter the pool for future members).","title":"AKRO Governance"},{"location":"sparta/#roles-on-the-platform","text":"Economic Objectives How does token help? Borrower Have access to an unsecured creditHave a regular availability of credit The token issued equivalently to the amount of DAI allows you to leave a request for an unsecured loan in the pool and collateralize a loan. The user can get a 200% loan of the amount of ASPT available.Also, high liquidity in the pool formed by depositing funds, using a token, attracting users according to the bonding curve, implies the constant presence of a \"living\" asset available for a loan. Thus, the user has access to an unsecured loan. Liquidity provider To grant loans with the best risk/profit ratio Providing capital in ASPT, the provider can stake for the requests of borrowers, receiving a percentage of interest. Also, since the governance is working by voting in ASPT, its holding allows participating in collective voting for various decisions, for example, changing the interest rate or bonding curve parameters.","title":"Roles on the platform"},{"location":"spartafaq/","text":"Sparta FAQ General What is Sparta? Sparta is a credit pool where users can get access to loans without the need of large collaterals. Its mechanics allows the Sparta users to get an undercollateralized loan, as well as provide funds at a percentage of interest. Why Sparta? Sparta model solves the over-collateralization problem in DeFi. With it, users can get access to a loan with 50% collateral. One of the advantages of our pool is that we have a collective responsibility and staking guarantee approach. Because the users are being rewarded for voting for good participants, they act as native risk assessors in the system, supporting its stability. Additionally, we implemented a bonding curve (Continuous Token Model with ASPT) to our pool. This gives an additional incentive for users to join the pool at the start of it. It also allows them to leave the pool at any moment without the problem of locked funds due to lack of liquidity assets. But what is a bonding curve? A bonding curve is a mathematical curve defining the price/supply correlation. A user enters and exit the DAO by buying and selling ASPTs on a price determined by this curve. What is the Akropolis Sparta Pool Token (ASPT)? ASPT \u2013 the native ERC20 token of the DAO, minted on the bonding curve. Gives the right to vote for investment decisions and to get access to loans. The ASPT minting is \u201cfully UI abstracted\u201d, meaning users don\u2019t need to deal with it directly. How do I use the service? Connect your wallet to our platform and deposit DAI. After that, you can start using the pool. What are the fees? Our pool does not take commissions at the moment. Participating in the pool How can I join the pool? Click on this link to access Sparta. Connect with your wallet (Bitski, Metamask, Connectwallet, Formatic, Portis, Squarelink) and deposit DAI. When you enter the pool, your entrance automatically calculates the poolToken price and you receive an equal amount of ASPT, enabling you to use the pool. How can I leave the pool? Just click \u201cwithdraw\u201d and your available funds will sell on the bonding curve price and return to your connected wallet in DAI. Please be aware that locked funds, staked for somebody\u2019s loan cannot be withdrawn until the loan paid back by the borrower. Why is my available balance different from the deposited amount? Conducting any operations in DAI, whether they\u2019re deposit or withdrawal, will be represented as ASPT in the pool. As there is a spread between entry and exit prices, as well as fluctuation of the price on the bonding curve, your actual deposit will differ from available balance. For example, after depositing 100 DAI you may see only 97 DAI available and -3 DAI in profit. Loan issuance How can I take a loan? When creating a loan request, you need to provide half of the loan amount as collateral. The pool members will need to stake additional 100% in your favour. A request with 150% collateral can only be activated by the borrower. To create a loan request, go to the Pool overview page and in the Pool information section, click the \u201cGet loan\u201d button. A pop-up will open. There, you\u2019ll need to enter the loan parameters and confirm the intention to create a deposit, then confirm the transaction sending. After creating the request, you can see it on the \u201cProposals\u201d page and on the \u201cMy loans\u201d page. How can I lend funds? Staking for a loan request allows the user to receive part of the loan interest paid by the borrower. You can become a guarantor in any loan on the Proposals page, which displays all open loan applications. To do this, select the loan and click on the Stake button. When you see the pop-up, you need to enter the amount of the deposit and confirm the intention to make it, then confirm the sending of the transaction. After making a stake on the Proposals page, you will see your share of interest that you received from the payments on this loan. All loans in which the user is the guarantor can be viewed on the page \u201cMy guarantees\u201d. Can I unstake my funds? Yes. Prior to the activation of a loan, any guarantor can withdraw a deposit from the loan request. To do this, click the \u201cUnstake\u201d button in the loan request card on the \u201cProposals\u201d page or on the \u201cMy guarantees\u201d page. In the pop-up that opens, you need to enter the amount for withdrawal and confirm the intention to withdraw the stake from the loan request, then confirm the transaction is sent. How can I repay a loan? IIn order to repay a loan, you need to click on the \u201cRepay\u201d button on the \u201cMy loan\u201d page. Next, you need to enter the amount for the cancellation and confirm the intention to perform the cancellation, then confirm the sending of the transaction. After the repayment, the loan amount displayed in the \u201cLoan\u201d column on the \u201cMy loans\u201d page should decrease, and all guarantors should unlock a part of the collateral and accrue interest. How can I claim interest? On the \u201cMy guarantees\u201d page, you can see how much interest was accumulated in the issued loans, and how much collateral is available for unlocking. The accumulated interest is displayed in the Earn column, and the Unlock X.XX DAI button will display how much can be unlocked. After clicking the Unlock X.XX DAI button, you will need to confirm the intention to withdraw funds from the loan, then confirm the sending of the transaction. Unlocked funds fall into the available balance. What happens if a loan is not repaid? In the case of non-repayment loan is liquidated 90 days after the issuance or partial repayment of. The deposited collateral will be burnt and a partial repayment (if exist) will be distributed between the users who staked for this loan. Security Where are my deposited funds stored? All user funds are stored on-chain in smart contracts, Sparta is not a custodial solution. Has your product been audited? Akropolis is currently undergoing a security audit from CertiK, which will take about a month. After the audit, the results will be announced publicly. Have you modelled potential attacks on the pool? We plan to launch a regression testing in the near future. For this, we will create scripts that we described in the YML format. As part of this approach, we will manipulate various parameters that the pool works with and monitor its behaviour. This way we can predict how the pool works under certain circumstances. Is a flashloan attack against your pool possible? These kinds of attacks do not affect the Sparta. Attacks of this type are specific to flash loans platforms. A flash loan is an unsecured form of loan that is issued for an ultra-short time. In fact everything is executed in one transaction. Accordingly, in the interval between the beginning of a transaction and its end, opens up a possibility for manipulation. This type of attack could be a potential threat to our governance module, but this element is still under development and we will add preventive measures before it goes live.

Over time, they have undergone a vast number of transformations, changing the formats and principles of interaction. However, the essence of Financial Systems has always prevailed - helping people realize their needs. Financial systems started as informal savings and lending groups and evolved into co-operatives, mutual insurances, and co-operative banks, which became the commercial and retail banks that we know today through centuries of growth, mergers, and acquisitions. The current legacy system has become opaque, inefficient [1], and too big to fail [2]. The fintech revolution aims to correct these failures by disrupting the financial market and creating new, community-focused models. Akropolis is a financial protocol for the growing billion-dollar informal economy [3]. Autonomous Financial Organizations have existed for centuries. They are common throughout the world, whether as rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs), or co-operatives. Through rigorous research, we have found that Kenyan Chamas \u2013saving circles \u2013 are the most profitable informal financial organizations. Chamas register US$4bn in savings annually and the overall informal economy contributes more than 47% of Kenya\u2019s GDP. However, due to the nature of their informality, these organizations are oftentimes subject to fraud, fund mismanagement, and corruption. We believe that the future of finance belongs to user-owned - but not necessarily user-governed - networks. Our thesis proposes that banks and other financial corporations will be replaced by a federated network of autonomous co-ops, each of which will act in the interests of its owners and interact with other parties in a single digital financial landscape. The Akropolis protocol aims to create this new digital financial landscape by providing a unified program interface for the cooperation and exchange of value of digital financial organizations. Overview What is Akropolis? Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal bank-less economy. It can be implemented on any blockchain with a Turing-complete [4] virtual machine. Our proposed initial implementation is on the Ethereum blockchain. Within Akropolis, users are free to choose decentralized smart contract-based self-custody or nominate a regulated custodian. The protocol or its team do, and will not store user data or engage in regulated activities such as facilitating or promoting investment activities. What problems does it address? The complexity of starting an autonomous financial organization (AFO) The geographic lottery of financial services availability Allowing trust-minimised exchanges of value between groups (digital co-ops, guilds, mutuals), as social trust is not scalable. Security, reliability and transparency of informal financial organizations How does it propose to solve them? Quickly set-up, operate and grow informal autonomous financial organisations (AFOs) like digital co-ops, guilds, and mutuals - with no geographical limits Connect AFOs to a previously impossible interoperable scalable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, lend/borrow, trade); Reducing instances of fraud and misuse of funds Providing benefits of aggregation to users who would otherwise not be able to afford access to them Key Features No bank account required DeFi integrations provide for a continuous savings rate No need for long-term lockups to receive interest - continuous interest payment Resistance to fraud or manipulation Provable solvency Ability to receive funds even if the organisation dissolves or fails Scaling potential to co-operative bank model User incentives to grow the network, lower the cost of use and speed up the delivery of services Full funds ownerships in a trustless way: funds are stored in an on-chain ledger where only verified users with permissions have access to them Transparent, real-time, immutable financial record-keeping for every user \u2013 solving fraud and minimizing the misuse of funds through multi-signature fund deployment Programmable immutable smart-contracts that allow users to create automated financial algorithms. These algorithms implement the functionality of existing financial instruments and enable the creation of a large array of novel financial tools. Target Users Unbanked individuals and communities across the globe. Individuals are parties, under-served by the legacy financial system Network Actors End-users - all network users, participating in at least one AFO. Autonomous Finance Organizations and their associations (Guilds). AFOs can be created as public or private. Each organization can have a legal entity, registered in any jurisdiction, but this is not a barrier of entry. The Guild is an association of AFOs, that is governed by members according to its constitution. Capital providers: this category comprises internal and external capital providers. Network keepers: token holders, participating in staking and governance processes. They are profit-seeking agents rewarded for correct risk assessments by receiving a network stability fee. End-users, capital providers and external individuals can be network keepers. Each type has a unique set of goals detailed below: Type of actor Economic objectives Incentives/Interaction with AKRO tokens End-user Save and earn profit using an AFO Have access to cheap loans provided by their AFO Incentivized to commit money into the AFO according to the established plan and to repay loans taken from the AFO budget as a result of internal social pressure. End users don\u2019t generally use the AKRO tokens AFOs (Borrowers) and their associations (Guilds) Secure access to well-priced and easily available credit Maximise availability of credit and minimise its price Maximise the duration and terms of the credit lines Referral incentives: grow the network through referring other AFOs ( encouraging other AFOs to be moved to or set up on our network). The greater the volume of successfully repaid credit, the greater will be the reputational value of the system, and the lower the cost of credit; Ability to attract a greater volume of credit proportional to the overall value captured in the system. Two mechanisms: maximise through growth in number of AFO members, or association with new AFOs in Guilds. This is important as a fractional-reserve banking approach is not available or applicable to non-bank AFOs. The above increases the volume of staked tokens in the system, thus reducing the token circulating supply Private AFO To work with savings of members in private mode without interaction with other ecosystem actors Incentivized to run all internal processes properly - otherwise, members can easily leave if they do not have any obligations or debts with the group. Private AFOs do not participate in the network, therefore not requiring tokens Capital Providers (Lenders) To grant loans with the best risk/profit ratio To be protected from fraud and defaults on debts by AFOs through network mechanisms A token staking mechanism creates a collective scoring system that helps Capital Providers to make correct decisions and decreases credit risk The governance approach allows Capital Providers to affect network variables that are decisive to their profit, such as the stability fee and the intra-network rate (analogous to LIBOR) Network Keepers [5] Maximise stability fee through correct risk assessments Earn additional rewards in tokens from a Growth Fund Staking and governance functions are enabled by holding the token which provides both an incentive and skin in the game to facilitate sustainable network growth. Network keepers act as underwriters of Guilds\u2019 default risk. They get rewards for correct default risk predictions through a % of the Capital Provider income from a specific Guild. In some cases - additional rewards (AKRO tokens from Growth Fund). The idea is to support the network\u2019s bootstrapping at its early stages of operation by awarding additional tokens to the stakers. This approach proved its efficiency to engage token holders to stake their tokens in well-known Livepeer project. Their stake is partially burnt if one Guild member defaults on debt Incentivised to create a public, data-rich reputation or credit scoring system to maximise their return, which can only be done through network growth The Guild concept For the informal economy, the cooperation inside an informal group is as important as interactions between groups. Lack of trust between different groups is a large problem in the interactions between and within informal financial institutions. The Guild concept is a historically proven solution to lack of trust. Guilds, Chambers Of Commerce [6], Business associations, and Self-regulated organizations (SROs )[7] play a significant role for both domestic and international commerce. As a company or a professional worker, being a member of a trusted and respectful association significantly decreases risks associated with interacting. In the Akropolis network, Guilds are associations of AFOs that act as self-governed professional associations to grow trust between AFOs and members. Technical Architecture The architecture of our protocol, as a TCP/IP construction, is structured in several layers, each of which is responsible for a separate function: Identity Management module (IM) Accounting module AFO maintenance and Governance Module Network Governance module Payment processing Module (C2FC Framework) More details about the functionality of each level will be described in the following sections. Each level has its own API for interacting with other layers or for interacting with applications built on our protocol and third-party solutions. Cross-functionality between AFOs will initially be limited to basic exchanges of value. Identity Management Module One of the limitations of the current state of Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) frameworks is the lack of a single entry point for digital ID and membership management through all organizations. Our aim is to build a single entry-point for interaction with all AFOs of which the user is a member. The user profile allows registration for membership in several organizations and functions as a single interface for managing all of them, in the same way that Slack supports participation in different teams. A user in a single interface can view all the AFOs in which they are a member, and manage the permissions and privileges that they have granted to the AFOs. Identity management (IM) occurs through a generalised approach, based on the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) [8]. Quote ENS offers a secure & decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names (e.g. akropolis.eth). ENS is built on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and operates in a distributed fashion for both its infrastructure and governance. [9] Akropolis uses the same logic to create a single interface for managing all AFOs. Our IM keeps the following records: Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers, for example, a hash with a document copy or IPFS [10] link List of all created Guilds List of all created AFOs List of all AFO members The IM also provides interfaces for connecting third-party identity systems, both centralized and decentralized. External services can be connected using our API. As such, IM provides a pseudo-anonymous service through a pending robust zkSnark [11]/zkStark [12] implementation. IM does not store personal data, neither does it deal with KYCs. User connects to any application using our protocol. The application requests information about the user. The Identity Management Module retrieves a list of AFOs of which the user is a member from the on-chain ledger. The Identity Management Module sends the user address from its public off-chain data (IPFS / Swarm / Server) alongside the list of AFOs to the application The app requests off-chain identity-relevant information. Building reputation systems using Akropolis protocol We envision a scenario where the network participants can provide and request user identification and personal data collection services (using IPFS / nuCypher [13] or centralized servers), combine them with financial transactions that are stored on-chain, and provide AFO risk assessment services to third parties. We do not centrally store protocol user data or provide scoring and risk assessment within the protocol. All financial transactions of agents are stored on-chain. We provide an API to get data on all issued loans on the protocol and its repayments. Any third-party can access pseudo-anonymised transactions on-chain and assess the risk on their own, or use third-parties to assess the risk. AFOs may choose to shared off-chain information in order to get access to competitively-priced credit from external capital providers. As a result, a third-party can combine various data sources to create a credit scoring system. As noted above, pending an effective anonymisation and gas-effective zkSNARKs solution for Ethereum, our restrictions will be limited to those of the native chain. User provides KYC and other data to Reputation Service, which is necessary to estimate their risk score. The Reputation Service gets the links to the user\u2019s external personal data providers from the from Identity Management Module The Reputation Service gets user data from external data providers The Reputation Service gets data on user financial operations in the Akropolis protocol (loans received and payments on them, savings) from the on-chain ledger The Reputation Service calculates the score and provides it to the Network Keeper Payment processing kernel \u2013 C2FC Framework The Akropolis protocol has created a specialized financial primitive \u2013 Commitments to Future Cash Flows (C2FC), which allows us to transform any financial interaction into an exchange of tokenised cash flows. C2FC (Commitments to Future Cash Flows) is a financial primitive designed to enable seamless transfer, exchange, batching or trading of cash flows, linked to and issued by any party, be it a human, a corporate, a DAO, or a machine. The C2FC framework serves to simplify transactional and payments functionality by reducing all exchanges of value to claims on cash flows. C2FC is responsible for routing all payments in the protocol. Any interaction within the financial ecosystem (be it legacy or crypto) can be presented as an exchange of cash flows between two parties: the provider of capital (user or lender) and the utiliser of capital (service provider or borrower). C2FC acts as an automatically executed right to claim a defined part of future cash flows that arrive at the issuer\u2019s address within a given timeframe. C2FC issuance allows present-value future cash flows of any business or individual to be stored as a single token; and be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. This primitive simplifies workflows and widens the potential for new DeFi instruments and interactions. The C2FC token acts as a transmitter that forwards cash flow from the issuer (borrower) to the C2FC token holder (lender) under initially pre-defined conditions. C2FC Implementation C2FC is currently implemented as a non-fungible token, that operates a set of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network. Every token is unique and contains the following data: Address of payer C2FC agreement parameters: Payment periodicity Payment currency, abstracted as a token address Number of payments Generalized loan model The Akropolis protocol uses a generalized credit model for the implementation of credit products using C2FC, which specifies how the regular payments amount is calculated. Installment is the amount of regular repayment of the loan, and Interest Rate p.a. is the interest rate per annum. Installments are distributed and, in sum, repay the loan principal ( Loan Principal ) and loan interest ( Interest ). There are two types of loans accessible in our protocol - Annuity and differentiated payments. An annuity payment remains unchanged for the duration of the loan agreement. Every month, the user will pay for the loan in equal installments, consisting of accrued interest on the loan and the part charged to the principal. In the case of differentiated payments, a user\u2019s payment will decrease with each passing month because the debt will be extinguished in equal shares, and interest will be charged monthly on the balance of the debt. Annuity model Installment = K * Original Loan Amount i = Interest Rate p.a. / 12 K = i * (1+i)^{Number of installments}/((1+i)^{Number of installments}-1) Interest = Remaining Loan Amount * i Loan Principal = Installment - Interest Remaining Loan Amount_{t+1} = Remaining Loan Amount_{t} - Loan Principal_{t}, Where Remaining Loan Amount is the amount of debt after t-th Installment has been paid. Reducing balance model Loan Principal = Original Loan Amount / Number of Installments Interest = Remaining Loan Amount * Interest Rate p.a / 12. Remaining Loan Amount_{t+1} = Remaining Loan Amount_{t} - Loan Principal_{t} Installment = Loan Principal + Interest Ethereum Implementation C2FC has already been implemented on the Ethereum mainnet and we are working on the C2FC financial primitive implementation on Polkadot. C2FC is materially different to the current implementations of ERC948 (EIP 1337) [14] and EIP1620 [15]. The following features are improved: Direct debit initialisation by the sender Ability to realize escrow logic for payments receiver Ability to transfer ownership to receive recurring payments: transferred to another person Tokens are composable and can be grouped into a portfolio according to predefined characteristics You can check the deployed smart contracts for C2FC and source code here: Code # Mainnet address 0x98466a02404b939c5ee34030c3aab8a47aab80ab # Kovan Address 0xb272fa8bd66fbd310165d322febd5e275081f886 Github Practical example: Alice wants to borrow $1000 for 12 months with an interest rate of 10% per annum. Bob agrees to provide her with funds on these terms. In the traditional banking system, Alice and Bob will have to sign a contract in which all the conditions will be written out and which will serve as a basis for dispute resolution. In the Akropolis protocol Alice releases a C2FC token in which it registers repayments parameters and sells this token to Bob. The C2FC token stores all information on the credit parameters and its return in the blockchain in an immutable form. Consider how it looks from a technical point of view. To create cashflow Alice can call the existing C2FC implementation or re-write her own implementation (or use somebody\u2019s else). The C2FC contract should adhere to the interface of C2FCPayments , which inherits the IC2FC interface . Main interface description as implemented in C2FC: Function createCashflow This function registers the cash flow in the system, captures the cash flow parameters and creates a token corresponding to this cash flow. This token can be transferred or sold to any ethereum address owner. /** * @dev @dev Function for create Cashflow * @param name string name of Cashflow * @param value uint256 maximum value for Cashflow * @param commit uin256 unit for payment in period (default, month) * @param interestRate uin256 size of interest above value * @param duration uint256 period of Cashflow */ function createCashFlow( string memory name, uint256 value, uint256 commit, uint256 interestRate, uint256 duration, uint256 stackingTokens ) public returns (bool); Function executePayment This function creates a new payment order. If the cash flow creator has enough funds to redeem the payment order, the funds from his wallet are automatically debited to the account of the owner of the token. The amount charged is stored on the C2FC smart contract and is available for withdrawal only by the owner of the token. If there are not enough funds in the cash flow creator\u2019s wallet, the payment order is stored in the system with the status active. /** * @dev Execute payment order * @param tokenId uint256 ID of the token (base token, for example, ERC721) * @param tokenAmount uint256 value for payment * @return true or false operation */ function executePayment( uint256 tokenId, uint256 tokenAmount //the token amount paid to the publisher ) public returns (bool success); Function withdrawPayments Funds withdrawn from the token issuer\u2019s wallet are recorded and stored in a smart contract. The owner of the token can, at any time, call the function withdrawPayments and withdraw the funds to his wallet. /** * @dev Withdraw payments from Cashflow * @param tokenId uint256 ID of the token (base token, for example, ERC721) * @param amount uint256 value for withdraw * @return true or false operation */ function withdrawPayments( uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount ) public returns (bool success); In our example, Alice creates a cash flow by calling the createCashflow function and selling the token to Bob. Bob receives the obligations of Alice: the loan, which she will have to repay according to the conditions specified in the tokenized cash flow. Then, Bob periodically calls the executePayment function (or, more likely, Bob will use some existing dApp to automate the process, for example, CashflowRelay.com) and receives regular payments from Alice to his account. Upon completion of the loan repayment, Bob withdraws funds from the smart contract by calling the withdrawFunds function. Network Governance Module The governance framework allows decision-making within AFOs. Autonomous financial institutions are completely digital objects that can make their own financial decisions, accumulate funds, provide accumulated funds for a long time, take loans and pay them off. These AFO decisions are made by way of token holder voting in accordance with the chosen governance model. The Governance layer provides AFOs with high-level decision-making mechanisms, and \u201cdelegates\u201d these decisions to the low-level transaction layer. The governance framework will initially enable the following functionality, supported by the API: Registration of a financial organization Making changes to the constitution Adding a new user Excluding a user from an organization Profit distribution Buying or selling assets Lend money to another AFO Borrow money from another AFO A borrower issues a C2FC token for getting a loan and puts an order on the C2FC exchange. A member of an AFO suggests filing existing loan applications in order to get the loan interest. Voting system created. All co-op members can vote. According to the result of voting, if passed, the relevant finances are withdrawn from the co-op\u2019s account. AFO/Co-op funds are used to purchase a C2FC token. Co-op\u2019s account gets the C2FC token. Borrower pays for their C2FC obligations. The payments are routed to the Co-op account. Network Governance All network actors holding tokens can participate in the governance process of the overall network, and vote on ecosystem variables such as the stability fee, penalty fee, governance fee and the intra-network loan rate, modelled on LIBOR [16] or DIPOR [17]. The governance of the network is executed by token holders \u2013 it is a collective establishment of critically important variables. The governance mechanism helps balance the interests of all actors and allows a decentralized determination of crucial parameters. Our system design does not require an internal stabilisation mechanism, but rather seeks to establish a balance of internal (intra-network) lending rate. The main variables to govern are listed below: Stability fee, staker\u2019s reward Penalty fee, the penalty applied to a stake in case of dishonest behaviour of a Guild Intra-network interest rate, the maximum interest rate that can be applied to a loan in the network Governance fee, which is charged in AKRO tokens from every successfully repaid loan and burned, initially established as zero Actors incentivization The network keepers are interested in high stability fees (giving them higher profits) and low penalty fees (which would reduce their risk). The Guilds (AFOs) are interested mostly in low-interest rates, but also high stability fees and low penalty fees, as in this case, if they stake tokens in favor of themselves, they receive a significant discount on an interest rate of a loan at low risk. (. The capital providers are interested in low stability fees (as this leads to higher profits) and high penalty fees (as this would incentivize an increase in the quality of AFO selection by token holders). Thus, these three main network actors have at least two opposite sides in terms of values within the ecosystem variables. Because of their opposing views, all three types of agents in the network have a strong incentive to participate in governance and attempt to influence network parameters in their favor. They can be assured that other agents will act against their interests if they do not. The different stakeholders have the following incentives for network parameters: Stakeholder Stability fees Penalty fees Interest rates, controlled through infra-network rate Network keepers High, for higher profits Low, for lower risk Medium - to prevent under incentivization or default AFOs and Guilds High, for discount on loan repayments when staking for own loans Low, for low risk when staking for own loans Low, for cheaper loans Capital providers Low, for higher profits High, because that would incentivize more rigorous risk assessments High, for higher profits Additionally, Guilds are incentivized to attract reliable members that repay debts adequately, as timely repayments lead to a better reputation and higher level of community trust. Higher community trust, expressed in stakes for the Guild, therefore decreases the cost to access new capital for the Guild. Along with this, Guilds are interested in holding tokens and staking them in favor of themselves to receive an additional deduction from the interest rate of a loan, and in participation in governance to have an influence on network parameters. Meanwhile, Network Keepers are incentivized to participate in honest Guild selection as it leads to receiving profits and to make the best assessment of the Guilds\u2019 credibility as possible. Besides this, they have to hold as many tokens as they can to have a voice in the governance process, because the stability and penalty fee values are critical for their business. The capital providers are incentivized to provide loans to the most trusted Guilds in the network. Guilds gain reputation and trust when they pay back their debt diligently, thus community trust signifies a lower risk of default, and, therefore, a better risk/reward ratio for capital providers. Capital providers are highly motivated to hold tokens as participation in governance and influence on stability and penalty fee values, as well as the infra-network interest rate, is critical for their business. Further, capital providers are interested in network growth as it opens the lending market for them. Therefore, capital providers may also stake in favor of trusted Guilds, becoming network keepers, and work towards accelerated network growth. Our incentive analysis demonstrates that all main actors presented in the ecosystem are motivated to hold tokens and participate in the governance process as it is critical for their business inside the network. The \u201ccommunity trust\u201d staking mechanism in conjunction with the decentralized governance approach builds a game of incentives that can balance the aims of all actors. This model was inspired by the MakerDAO (MKR) token model [18]. Network Internal Economy Staking Mechanism The mechanics of a staking process are described below. We used the approach developed by Livepeer [19] that comes down to using \u201crounds\u201d as the definition of time in a staking process. We named the \u201crounds\u201d \u201cstandard periods\u201d within our model: The timeline of the ecosystem is quantized by standard periods. It means that loans and repayment terms are tied to periods. For example, if a loan is for 4 standard periods, and the period is one week, the loan has a 4-week duration. All stakes from token holders are accepted for a certain period, during which they are frozen and cannot be withdrawn, acting as skin in the \u201cCommunity trust\u201d game. This period is countable in standard periods. Example: if the token holders stake their tokens in favor of a specific Guild, they define the staking period as M standard periods, where M is a natural number. The bid/ask orders are sent by lenders/borrowers during the standard period and executed before the new one starts. We are considering both algorithmic liquidity pooling (an example is Compound) and trading with discrete peers (an example is Dharma), following this classification [20]. Each Guild cannot borrow more funds than defined by its share in community trust (staking). A Guild cannot borrow a higher share of the funds from the overall supply in recent N periods than its staking share. This principle works according to this formula: So, If the possibility of taking a loan worth \u0394 for i-th Guild is under consideration, the staking system verifies that if a loan is taken, the equation will be true, meaning that a share of this Guild in a loan-taking process is not exceeding its staking share. The \u03a3L is referred to all loans during the N periods, including partially or completely repaid ones. This rule is applied only if N periods have passed. If the system is just launched and N periods have not yet passed, the system will wait for a collection of loan-related statistics, and only after this, the application the mentioned limitation will occur. During the initial period, the lenders have to take into account not only the tokens staked in favor of each Guild, but also the Guild\u2019s reputation and payment history as the leading indicators for their decision-making. As all community stakes \u2013 including stakes from AFOs that are members of a specific Guild \u2013 are placed for a defined period, it is easy to create a graph for every Guild that will indicate a number of staked tokens vs. time in periods. This is important as loans are processes spread over time, so the lender needs to see how many tokens will still be staked for a Guild after some time because it is the Guild\u2019s reliability indicator. In case of default on debt, the stake in favor of the Guild is penalized according to the established penalty fee. Collective determination of trustworthy AFOs The first token function is a collective selection of trustworthy AFOs via staking in favor of AFO associations, Guilds. An AFOs within-network debt creation is based on the C2FC concept that was described above. The issuance of C2FCs by AFOs is initially limited and depends only on community trust (or number of tokens, staked in favor of their Guild). Any AKRO token holder can stake his tokens on behalf of any Guild they trust, for example, as a result of a careful examination of a Guild\u2019s financial flows and history. The amount of debt that can be issued by a Guild is limited by its share in overall staked tokens, which are equivalent to its community trust. The possibility to work with loans attracted by the Guild is managed inside it, the most obvious approach being to select AFOs by their stakes in favor of this Guild and taking into account its financial history. Whichever method of internal loan management they choose, the responsibility for loan repayment pertains to the Guild as a collective. Token Model (AKRO) Token Type Network token Token Use Governance and Work Token Comparable token models MKR[21]*, Livepeer[22]* Value creation and value capture Curated supply of community-vetted borrowers and incentivized external lenders balanced out by network keepers who are incentivized to maintain sustainable network growth. Network adoption is driven by lack of adequate banking alternatives; adoption will drive the demand for the network token, whilst staking and burning reduces its supply. *We are using a similar governance approach. ** We don\u2019t have token inflation as in the Livepeer protocol, but we have similar mechanics to delegate stakes in favor of network actors and allow them to perform actions in the network. Our actors are rewarded in AKRO for their staking activity from the Growth Fund. Token Design Principles The main issue that prevents the informal economy from scaling is the fact that AFOs are economically isolated from each other due to a lack of trust. The AKRO token design was introduced with the purpose to solve this problem and establish a trusted network amongst potentially adversarial parties. The AKRO token was designed to solve the problem of network trust and enable network governance. At its core, it involves two processes: Community Trust \u2013staking in favor of Guilds \u2013 and the Governance process. The problem of mistrust is solved by using special staking mechanisms (Community trust). The staking process is designed to make fraudulent activity unprofitable and reward honest and reliable participants. The governance process is modelled largely on MakerDAO and designed to balance the interests of various actors in the network. Utility Using the OutlierVentures classification [23], the Akropolis token can be classified as a Network Token, combining the Work and Governance functionality. It provides the right to contribute work to a network and participate in the governance process. Its utility is derived from the decentralized coordination of token holders, as with Augur (REP) [24], MakerDAO (MKR), Numeraire (NMR) [25], and Livepeer (LPT). Our token has been modeled referencing MKR and LPT in particular as the network objectives are highly comparable. Role and purpose: what is the token role? Our token is classified as a Network Token, combining the Work and Governance functionalities. It provides functionality within the Akropolis network, and can be used to control the access to liquidity, provide governance functionality, and/or contribute capital to the network. As such, the AKRO token is an essential element of the protocol internal economy and cannot be replaced by an external stablecoin. The token staking and governance approach requires a token whose value is connected to the current network and not tied to other projects and networks. Other examples of network tokens with aligned objectives are those of Ocean Protocol [26], Fetch [27], and Ethereum. The loans will be provided in known and reliable stablecoins, which will be further used to repay such loans and interest. AKRO will not be used for this purpose. AKRO tokens only serve to create an incentivization scheme for the interaction of different AFOs with each other. The implementation of this mechanism will be within the interoperability layer of our protocol. The interoperability layer\u2019s main purpose is to enable AFOs to seamlessly and cheaply exchange value and data. Value Proposition The network\u2019s raison-d\u2019etre is to create value for its participants and to either (a) meet a current need, or (b) enable a novel, previously inconceivable or impossible value-accretive functionality. Our value proposition addresses existing roadblocks to growth and scalability of AFOs and offers novel ways of interaction, governance and value exchange. The Network\u2019s benefits to users and token holders are: Substantial cost reduction, ease of set-up and low cost of maintenance; Reduction of perceived and real transactional risks; Network growth in terms of volume of transactions parsed through it and number of users; Scalability across geographies. Underlying value The value of the Akropolis token is tied to the key interactions between network participants, the possibility to receive profit by providing work for the network and to participate in the governance process. It should be noted that the token holder does not receive any profits by simply holding the token. The value is exchanged over the network, similar to Ethereum, Ocean, and Fetch. The Akropolis Network token does not grant the right to receive any profits, income, payments, returns, or dividends from Akropolis or any entity from its group of companies, nor is it intended to be a security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any kind of financial instrument or investment carrying equivalent rights. Token Functionality and Use by Stakeholder Type The token functionality and use is modeled using the Livepeer and MakerDAO frameworks and is designed to ensure that all participants, acting in their own self-interests, are motivated to (a) maximize the value captured through and by the network; and (b) maintain sustainable network growth. Please note that a party may combine roles for a greater impact within the network. (See Table on Page 5 for details on the interaction and uses of the token according to each network actor) Revenue model Funding mechanisms of open source networks are still subject to research and experimentation, with two notable examples from the commercial world. We anticipate various potential sources of revenue. All of the below have been validated with our partners and product specialists: % of the spread charged by external capital providers % of the spread from the financial services and products % of the remittances providers fees Go-to-Market Strategy Our generalised approach will initially focus on informal co-operatives and diaspora cooperatives with a strong remittances component. These groups are most likely to have an ability to bring in external capital and incentivise organic network growth without reliance on excessive debt. Digital natives Emerging markets: rotating savings and credit associations (roscas), inKenya, Ghana, Uganda, and some other African countries Europe: Broodfonds (Netherlands) [28] Europe; Mutual credit networks (Italy, UK, Switzerland) [29], Sardex (Italy) [30] and Wir (Switzerland) [31] Europe and emerging markets: community cooperative banks Risks and Limitations General risks Attacks against the decentralized components (smart contracts etc.) Failure of centralized infrastructures such as crypto-fiat conversion apps or native mobile apps. Competition with other credit services and organizations, especially informal ones in the areas of operation Complexity of product usage for ordinary users in target countries Risks, connected with implementation of the AKRO token model The collection of a majority of tokens by one of the three stakeholder groups (Guilds/AFOs, Network Keepers, Capital Providers), which will lead to a non-balanced governance strategy High risks of fraudulent behavior by Guilds/AFOs at the initial stage of network growth, connected to the low volume of stakes and reputation The complexity of buying tokens within AFOs to pay the governance fee. However, we assume that in the majority of cases, some Guild members will have staked tokens for the loan, so these can be automatically used to pay the governance fee) In the case of apathy of voters [32] (low level of participation in voting), the narrow group of token holders can change fundamental economic parameters of the network according to their own strategy An apathy of staking - where a majority of token holders avoid participation in staking, consequently exposing lenders to more significant risks. This can result in a deficit of lenders in the network. This problem is present primarily at the initial stage of network growth. We propose certain mechanisms, in some cases similar to those used by Livepeer, to incentivise participation in the staking process. The values of and ratios between the stability fee, penalty fee, and infra-network rate may not be adequately established, resulting in system imbalance (which means that at least one of the groups of network participants will be not satisfied by these variables). In such a case, the network growth will be seriously limited. Sybil attacks [33] Malefactors could create fraudulent AFOs and Guilds. These structures can act to undertake activities such as intentional loan default. The Community trust staking mechanics is one of the main protection measures for such attacks. Spam attacks - the creation of a lot of AFOs/Guilds for malicious means. One of the solutions is to freeze a certain amount on tokens for AFO/Guild creation and prevent their withdrawal until the created organization is recognized as honest according to the specific criteria of their members\u2019 activity. 51% attack In the Akropolis ecosystem, the term \u201c51% attack\u201d refers to an attack on governance processes by a conspiracy of >50% of active token holders (or the collection of this number of tokens by one small group). In this case, the attackers can establish variables of economic parameters serving only their own interests, which could destroy sustainable network operation. There are two protection measures: The economic rationality of the attackers - if they destroy the network, they will ultimately lose the value of the tokens Initial token distribution to stakeholders that are interested in network growth. The more significant Akropolis\u2019 capitalization becomes, the more complex and expensive such an attack will be. Roadmap Glossary Term Definition AFO (Autonomous financial organisations) Autonomous financial organisations are self-sovereign digital member-owned organisations that provide financial services such as co-savings and co-investing, access to credit on flexible terms, and a basic form of insurance. C2FC (Commitments to Future Cash Flows) [34] A financial primitive that represents the digital right to operate with future cash flows expected to arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (this could be implemented in any blockchain) within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder\u2019s address. Therefore, the future cash flows of any individual, company or service take the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. Governance Framework Autonomous financial organisations work as decentralised autonomous organisations. The governance inside each AFO is different from protocol governance: only AFO members are able to make decisions. There is no need for every autonomous financial organisation to have a token of its own. The Governance Framework provides decision-making support for Autonomous Financial Organisations. The core Governance API supports a number of base level commands, like the registration of a new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution, or allowing new members in. IM (Identity Management) The IM is analogous to the Ethereum Naming Service, which keeps the following records: Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers, e.g. hash with a document copy or IPFS link List of all created AFOs List of all AFO members Guilds (Association of AFOs) [35] [36] Guilds are self-governing structures formed by AFOs as members. Within the Akropolis network, Guilds can be described as something similar to Chambers Of Trade, Business associations or Self-regulated organizations. Basic network variables and definitions Stability fee - a reward for Network Keepers for staking in favor of \"honest\" Guilds (whose members repay debts diligently). This reward is charged as part of the interest rate of a loan. Penalty fee - a penalty, applied in situations of debt default of at least one Guild member to the stakes in their favor. All stakes are equally penalized for a certain percentage of tokens for every default event. Infra-network interest rate [37] - the maximum value of an interest rate that can be applied to a loan. Governance fee - the percentage of a debt that is required to be paid in AKRO tokens which are burned thereafter. Similar to MKR in MakerDAO. Staking - AKRO tokens placed as a risky deposit (commonly known as skin in the game) on a specific smart contract with purpose to perform the \u201cselection\u201d of honest Guilds by collective risk assessment. If the Guild members repay their debt diligently, the person who made a stake receives a reward in the form of a stability fee and, during the growth process additional rewards in AKRO tokens.

Over time, they have undergone a vast number of transformations, changing the formats and principles of interaction. However, the essence of Financial Systems has always prevailed - helping people realize their needs. Financial systems started as informal savings and lending groups and evolved into co-operatives, mutual insurances, and co-operative banks, which became the commercial and retail banks that we know today through centuries of growth, mergers, and acquisitions. The current legacy system has become opaque, inefficient [1], and too big to fail [2]. The fintech revolution aims to correct these failures by disrupting the financial market and creating new, community-focused models. Akropolis is a financial protocol for the growing billion-dollar informal economy [3]. Autonomous Financial Organizations have existed for centuries. They are common throughout the world, whether as rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs), or co-operatives. Through rigorous research, we have found that Kenyan Chamas \u2013saving circles \u2013 are the most profitable informal financial organizations. Chamas register US$4bn in savings annually and the overall informal economy contributes more than 47% of Kenya\u2019s GDP. However, due to the nature of their informality, these organizations are oftentimes subject to fraud, fund mismanagement, and corruption. We believe that the future of finance belongs to user-owned - but not necessarily user-governed - networks. Our thesis proposes that banks and other financial corporations will be replaced by a federated network of autonomous co-ops, each of which will act in the interests of its owners and interact with other parties in a single digital financial landscape. The Akropolis protocol aims to create this new digital financial landscape by providing a unified program interface for the cooperation and exchange of value of digital financial organizations.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"wp2019/#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"wp2019/#what-is-akropolis","text":"Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal bank-less economy.

Autonomous Finance Organizations and their associations (Guilds). AFOs can be created as public or private. Each organization can have a legal entity, registered in any jurisdiction, but this is not a barrier of entry. The Guild is an association of AFOs, that is governed by members according to its constitution. Capital providers: this category comprises internal and external capital providers. Network keepers: token holders, participating in staking and governance processes. They are profit-seeking agents rewarded for correct risk assessments by receiving a network stability fee. End-users, capital providers and external individuals can be network keepers. Each type has a unique set of goals detailed below: Type of actor Economic objectives Incentives/Interaction with AKRO tokens End-user Save and earn profit using an AFO Have access to cheap loans provided by their AFO Incentivized to commit money into the AFO according to the established plan and to repay loans taken from the AFO budget as a result of internal social pressure. End users don\u2019t generally use the AKRO tokens AFOs (Borrowers) and their associations (Guilds) Secure access to well-priced and easily available credit Maximise availability of credit and minimise its price Maximise the duration and terms of the credit lines Referral incentives: grow the network through referring other AFOs ( encouraging other AFOs to be moved to or set up on our network). The greater the volume of successfully repaid credit, the greater will be the reputational value of the system, and the lower the cost of credit; Ability to attract a greater volume of credit proportional to the overall value captured in the system. Two mechanisms: maximise through growth in number of AFO members, or association with new AFOs in Guilds. This is important as a fractional-reserve banking approach is not available or applicable to non-bank AFOs. The above increases the volume of staked tokens in the system, thus reducing the token circulating supply Private AFO To work with savings of members in private mode without interaction with other ecosystem actors Incentivized to run all internal processes properly - otherwise, members can easily leave if they do not have any obligations or debts with the group. Private AFOs do not participate in the network, therefore not requiring tokens Capital Providers (Lenders) To grant loans with the best risk/profit ratio To be protected from fraud and defaults on debts by AFOs through network mechanisms A token staking mechanism creates a collective scoring system that helps Capital Providers to make correct decisions and decreases credit risk The governance approach allows Capital Providers to affect network variables that are decisive to their profit, such as the stability fee and the intra-network rate (analogous to LIBOR) Network Keepers [5] Maximise stability fee through correct risk assessments Earn additional rewards in tokens from a Growth Fund Staking and governance functions are enabled by holding the token which provides both an incentive and skin in the game to facilitate sustainable network growth. Network keepers act as underwriters of Guilds\u2019 default risk. They get rewards for correct default risk predictions through a % of the Capital Provider income from a specific Guild. In some cases - additional rewards (AKRO tokens from Growth Fund). The idea is to support the network\u2019s bootstrapping at its early stages of operation by awarding additional tokens to the stakers. This approach proved its efficiency to engage token holders to stake their tokens in well-known Livepeer project.

The user profile allows registration for membership in several organizations and functions as a single interface for managing all of them, in the same way that Slack supports participation in different teams. A user in a single interface can view all the AFOs in which they are a member, and manage the permissions and privileges that they have granted to the AFOs.

ENS is built on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and operates in a distributed fashion for both its infrastructure and governance.

Our IM keeps the following records: Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers, for example, a hash with a document copy or IPFS [10] link List of all created Guilds List of all created AFOs List of all AFO members The IM also provides interfaces for connecting third-party identity systems, both centralized and decentralized. External services can be connected using our API. As such, IM provides a pseudo-anonymous service through a pending robust zkSnark [11]/zkStark [12] implementation. IM does not store personal data, neither does it deal with KYCs. User connects to any application using our protocol. The application requests information about the user. The Identity Management Module retrieves a list of AFOs of which the user is a member from the on-chain ledger. The Identity Management Module sends the user address from its public off-chain data (IPFS / Swarm / Server) alongside the list of AFOs to the application The app requests off-chain identity-relevant information.","title":"Identity Management Module"},{"location":"wp2019/#building-reputation-systems-using-akropolis-protocol","text":"We envision a scenario where the network participants can provide and request user identification and personal data collection services (using IPFS / nuCypher [13] or centralized servers), combine them with financial transactions that are stored on-chain, and provide AFO risk assessment services to third parties.

C2FC (Commitments to Future Cash Flows) is a financial primitive designed to enable seamless transfer, exchange, batching or trading of cash flows, linked to and issued by any party, be it a human, a corporate, a DAO, or a machine. The C2FC framework serves to simplify transactional and payments functionality by reducing all exchanges of value to claims on cash flows. C2FC is responsible for routing all payments in the protocol. Any interaction within the financial ecosystem (be it legacy or crypto) can be presented as an exchange of cash flows between two parties: the provider of capital (user or lender) and the utiliser of capital (service provider or borrower). C2FC acts as an automatically executed right to claim a defined part of future cash flows that arrive at the issuer\u2019s address within a given timeframe. C2FC issuance allows present-value future cash flows of any business or individual to be stored as a single token; and be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. This primitive simplifies workflows and widens the potential for new DeFi instruments and interactions. The C2FC token acts as a transmitter that forwards cash flow from the issuer (borrower) to the C2FC token holder (lender) under initially pre-defined conditions. C2FC Implementation C2FC is currently implemented as a non-fungible token, that operates a set of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network. Every token is unique and contains the following data: Address of payer C2FC agreement parameters: Payment periodicity Payment currency, abstracted as a token address Number of payments Generalized loan model The Akropolis protocol uses a generalized credit model for the implementation of credit products using C2FC, which specifies how the regular payments amount is calculated. Installment is the amount of regular repayment of the loan, and Interest Rate p.a. is the interest rate per annum. Installments are distributed and, in sum, repay the loan principal ( Loan Principal ) and loan interest ( Interest ). There are two types of loans accessible in our protocol - Annuity and differentiated payments. An annuity payment remains unchanged for the duration of the loan agreement. Every month, the user will pay for the loan in equal installments, consisting of accrued interest on the loan and the part charged to the principal. In the case of differentiated payments, a user\u2019s payment will decrease with each passing month because the debt will be extinguished in equal shares, and interest will be charged monthly on the balance of the debt. Annuity model Installment = K * Original Loan Amount i = Interest Rate p.a. / 12 K = i * (1+i)^{Number of installments}/((1+i)^{Number of installments}-1) Interest = Remaining Loan Amount * i Loan Principal = Installment - Interest Remaining Loan Amount_{t+1} = Remaining Loan Amount_{t} - Loan Principal_{t}, Where Remaining Loan Amount is the amount of debt after t-th Installment has been paid. Reducing balance model Loan Principal = Original Loan Amount / Number of Installments Interest = Remaining Loan Amount * Interest Rate p.a / 12. Remaining Loan Amount_{t+1} = Remaining Loan Amount_{t} - Loan Principal_{t} Installment = Loan Principal + Interest Ethereum Implementation C2FC has already been implemented on the Ethereum mainnet and we are working on the C2FC financial primitive implementation on Polkadot. C2FC is materially different to the current implementations of ERC948 (EIP 1337) [14] and EIP1620 [15].

Bob agrees to provide her with funds on these terms. In the traditional banking system, Alice and Bob will have to sign a contract in which all the conditions will be written out and which will serve as a basis for dispute resolution. In the Akropolis protocol Alice releases a C2FC token in which it registers repayments parameters and sells this token to Bob. The C2FC token stores all information on the credit parameters and its return in the blockchain in an immutable form. Consider how it looks from a technical point of view. To create cashflow Alice can call the existing C2FC implementation or re-write her own implementation (or use somebody\u2019s else). The C2FC contract should adhere to the interface of C2FCPayments , which inherits the IC2FC interface . Main interface description as implemented in C2FC: Function createCashflow This function registers the cash flow in the system, captures the cash flow parameters and creates a token corresponding to this cash flow. This token can be transferred or sold to any ethereum address owner. /** * @dev @dev Function for create Cashflow * @param name string name of Cashflow * @param value uint256 maximum value for Cashflow * @param commit uin256 unit for payment in period (default, month) * @param interestRate uin256 size of interest above value * @param duration uint256 period of Cashflow */ function createCashFlow( string memory name, uint256 value, uint256 commit, uint256 interestRate, uint256 duration, uint256 stackingTokens ) public returns (bool); Function executePayment This function creates a new payment order. If the cash flow creator has enough funds to redeem the payment order, the funds from his wallet are automatically debited to the account of the owner of the token. The amount charged is stored on the C2FC smart contract and is available for withdrawal only by the owner of the token. If there are not enough funds in the cash flow creator\u2019s wallet, the payment order is stored in the system with the status active. /** * @dev Execute payment order * @param tokenId uint256 ID of the token (base token, for example, ERC721) * @param tokenAmount uint256 value for payment * @return true or false operation */ function executePayment( uint256 tokenId, uint256 tokenAmount //the token amount paid to the publisher ) public returns (bool success); Function withdrawPayments Funds withdrawn from the token issuer\u2019s wallet are recorded and stored in a smart contract. The owner of the token can, at any time, call the function withdrawPayments and withdraw the funds to his wallet. /** * @dev Withdraw payments from Cashflow * @param tokenId uint256 ID of the token (base token, for example, ERC721) * @param amount uint256 value for withdraw * @return true or false operation */ function withdrawPayments( uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount ) public returns (bool success); In our example, Alice creates a cash flow by calling the createCashflow function and selling the token to Bob. Bob receives the obligations of Alice: the loan, which she will have to repay according to the conditions specified in the tokenized cash flow. Then, Bob periodically calls the executePayment function (or, more likely, Bob will use some existing dApp to automate the process, for example, CashflowRelay.com) and receives regular payments from Alice to his account. Upon completion of the loan repayment, Bob withdraws funds from the smart contract by calling the withdrawFunds function.","title":"Payment processing kernel \u2013 C2FC Framework"},{"location":"wp2019/#network-governance-module","text":"The governance framework allows decision-making within AFOs.

The governance of the network is executed by token holders \u2013 it is a collective establishment of critically important variables. The governance mechanism helps balance the interests of all actors and allows a decentralized determination of crucial parameters. Our system design does not require an internal stabilisation mechanism, but rather seeks to establish a balance of internal (intra-network) lending rate. The main variables to govern are listed below: Stability fee, staker\u2019s reward Penalty fee, the penalty applied to a stake in case of dishonest behaviour of a Guild Intra-network interest rate, the maximum interest rate that can be applied to a loan in the network Governance fee, which is charged in AKRO tokens from every successfully repaid loan and burned, initially established as zero Actors incentivization The network keepers are interested in high stability fees (giving them higher profits) and low penalty fees (which would reduce their risk). The Guilds (AFOs) are interested mostly in low-interest rates, but also high stability fees and low penalty fees, as in this case, if they stake tokens in favor of themselves, they receive a significant discount on an interest rate of a loan at low risk. (. The capital providers are interested in low stability fees (as this leads to higher profits) and high penalty fees (as this would incentivize an increase in the quality of AFO selection by token holders). Thus, these three main network actors have at least two opposite sides in terms of values within the ecosystem variables. Because of their opposing views, all three types of agents in the network have a strong incentive to participate in governance and attempt to influence network parameters in their favor. They can be assured that other agents will act against their interests if they do not. The different stakeholders have the following incentives for network parameters: Stakeholder Stability fees Penalty fees Interest rates, controlled through infra-network rate Network keepers High, for higher profits Low, for lower risk Medium - to prevent under incentivization or default AFOs and Guilds High, for discount on loan repayments when staking for own loans Low, for low risk when staking for own loans Low, for cheaper loans Capital providers Low, for higher profits High, because that would incentivize more rigorous risk assessments High, for higher profits Additionally, Guilds are incentivized to attract reliable members that repay debts adequately, as timely repayments lead to a better reputation and higher level of community trust. Higher community trust, expressed in stakes for the Guild, therefore decreases the cost to access new capital for the Guild. Along with this, Guilds are interested in holding tokens and staking them in favor of themselves to receive an additional deduction from the interest rate of a loan, and in participation in governance to have an influence on network parameters. Meanwhile, Network Keepers are incentivized to participate in honest Guild selection as it leads to receiving profits and to make the best assessment of the Guilds\u2019 credibility as possible. Besides this, they have to hold as many tokens as they can to have a voice in the governance process, because the stability and penalty fee values are critical for their business. The capital providers are incentivized to provide loans to the most trusted Guilds in the network. Guilds gain reputation and trust when they pay back their debt diligently, thus community trust signifies a lower risk of default, and, therefore, a better risk/reward ratio for capital providers. Capital providers are highly motivated to hold tokens as participation in governance and influence on stability and penalty fee values, as well as the infra-network interest rate, is critical for their business. Further, capital providers are interested in network growth as it opens the lending market for them. Therefore, capital providers may also stake in favor of trusted Guilds, becoming network keepers, and work towards accelerated network growth. Our incentive analysis demonstrates that all main actors presented in the ecosystem are motivated to hold tokens and participate in the governance process as it is critical for their business inside the network. The \u201ccommunity trust\u201d staking mechanism in conjunction with the decentralized governance approach builds a game of incentives that can balance the aims of all actors. This model was inspired by the MakerDAO (MKR) token model [18].","title":"Network Governance"},{"location":"wp2019/#network-internal-economy","text":"Staking Mechanism The mechanics of a staking process are described below. We used the approach developed by Livepeer [19] that comes down to using \u201crounds\u201d as the definition of time in a staking process. We named the \u201crounds\u201d \u201cstandard periods\u201d within our model: The timeline of the ecosystem is quantized by standard periods. It means that loans and repayment terms are tied to periods. For example, if a loan is for 4 standard periods, and the period is one week, the loan has a 4-week duration. All stakes from token holders are accepted for a certain period, during which they are frozen and cannot be withdrawn, acting as skin in the \u201cCommunity trust\u201d game. This period is countable in standard periods. Example: if the token holders stake their tokens in favor of a specific Guild, they define the staking period as M standard periods, where M is a natural number. The bid/ask orders are sent by lenders/borrowers during the standard period and executed before the new one starts. We are considering both algorithmic liquidity pooling (an example is Compound) and trading with discrete peers (an example is Dharma), following this classification [20]. Each Guild cannot borrow more funds than defined by its share in community trust (staking). A Guild cannot borrow a higher share of the funds from the overall supply in recent N periods than its staking share. This principle works according to this formula: So, If the possibility of taking a loan worth \u0394 for i-th Guild is under consideration, the staking system verifies that if a loan is taken, the equation will be true, meaning that a share of this Guild in a loan-taking process is not exceeding its staking share. The \u03a3L is referred to all loans during the N periods, including partially or completely repaid ones. This rule is applied only if N periods have passed. If the system is just launched and N periods have not yet passed, the system will wait for a collection of loan-related statistics, and only after this, the application the mentioned limitation will occur. During the initial period, the lenders have to take into account not only the tokens staked in favor of each Guild, but also the Guild\u2019s reputation and payment history as the leading indicators for their decision-making. As all community stakes \u2013 including stakes from AFOs that are members of a specific Guild \u2013 are placed for a defined period, it is easy to create a graph for every Guild that will indicate a number of staked tokens vs. time in periods. This is important as loans are processes spread over time, so the lender needs to see how many tokens will still be staked for a Guild after some time because it is the Guild\u2019s reliability indicator. In case of default on debt, the stake in favor of the Guild is penalized according to the established penalty fee. Collective determination of trustworthy AFOs The first token function is a collective selection of trustworthy AFOs via staking in favor of AFO associations, Guilds. An AFOs within-network debt creation is based on the C2FC concept that was described above. The issuance of C2FCs by AFOs is initially limited and depends only on community trust (or number of tokens, staked in favor of their Guild). Any AKRO token holder can stake his tokens on behalf of any Guild they trust, for example, as a result of a careful examination of a Guild\u2019s financial flows and history. The amount of debt that can be issued by a Guild is limited by its share in overall staked tokens, which are equivalent to its community trust. The possibility to work with loans attracted by the Guild is managed inside it, the most obvious approach being to select AFOs by their stakes in favor of this Guild and taking into account its financial history. Whichever method of internal loan management they choose, the responsibility for loan repayment pertains to the Guild as a collective.","title":"Network Internal Economy"},{"location":"wp2019/#token-model-akro","text":"Token Type Network token Token Use Governance and Work Token Comparable token models MKR[21]*, Livepeer[22]* Value creation and value capture Curated supply of community-vetted borrowers and incentivized external lenders balanced out by network keepers who are incentivized to maintain sustainable network growth. Network adoption is driven by lack of adequate banking alternatives; adoption will drive the demand for the network token, whilst staking and burning reduces its supply. *We are using a similar governance approach. ** We don\u2019t have token inflation as in the Livepeer protocol, but we have similar mechanics to delegate stakes in favor of network actors and allow them to perform actions in the network. Our actors are rewarded in AKRO for their staking activity from the Growth Fund. Token Design Principles The main issue that prevents the informal economy from scaling is the fact that AFOs are economically isolated from each other due to a lack of trust. The AKRO token design was introduced with the purpose to solve this problem and establish a trusted network amongst potentially adversarial parties. The AKRO token was designed to solve the problem of network trust and enable network governance. At its core, it involves two processes: Community Trust \u2013staking in favor of Guilds \u2013 and the Governance process. The problem of mistrust is solved by using special staking mechanisms (Community trust). The staking process is designed to make fraudulent activity unprofitable and reward honest and reliable participants. The governance process is modelled largely on MakerDAO and designed to balance the interests of various actors in the network. Utility Using the OutlierVentures classification [23], the Akropolis token can be classified as a Network Token, combining the Work and Governance functionality. It provides the right to contribute work to a network and participate in the governance process. Its utility is derived from the decentralized coordination of token holders, as with Augur (REP) [24], MakerDAO (MKR), Numeraire (NMR) [25], and Livepeer (LPT). Our token has been modeled referencing MKR and LPT in particular as the network objectives are highly comparable. Role and purpose: what is the token role? Our token is classified as a Network Token, combining the Work and Governance functionalities. It provides functionality within the Akropolis network, and can be used to control the access to liquidity, provide governance functionality, and/or contribute capital to the network. As such, the AKRO token is an essential element of the protocol internal economy and cannot be replaced by an external stablecoin. The token staking and governance approach requires a token whose value is connected to the current network and not tied to other projects and networks. Other examples of network tokens with aligned objectives are those of Ocean Protocol [26], Fetch [27], and Ethereum. The loans will be provided in known and reliable stablecoins, which will be further used to repay such loans and interest. AKRO will not be used for this purpose. AKRO tokens only serve to create an incentivization scheme for the interaction of different AFOs with each other. The implementation of this mechanism will be within the interoperability layer of our protocol. The interoperability layer\u2019s main purpose is to enable AFOs to seamlessly and cheaply exchange value and data. Value Proposition The network\u2019s raison-d\u2019etre is to create value for its participants and to either (a) meet a current need, or (b) enable a novel, previously inconceivable or impossible value-accretive functionality. Our value proposition addresses existing roadblocks to growth and scalability of AFOs and offers novel ways of interaction, governance and value exchange. The Network\u2019s benefits to users and token holders are: Substantial cost reduction, ease of set-up and low cost of maintenance; Reduction of perceived and real transactional risks; Network growth in terms of volume of transactions parsed through it and number of users; Scalability across geographies. Underlying value The value of the Akropolis token is tied to the key interactions between network participants, the possibility to receive profit by providing work for the network and to participate in the governance process. It should be noted that the token holder does not receive any profits by simply holding the token. The value is exchanged over the network, similar to Ethereum, Ocean, and Fetch. The Akropolis Network token does not grant the right to receive any profits, income, payments, returns, or dividends from Akropolis or any entity from its group of companies, nor is it intended to be a security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any kind of financial instrument or investment carrying equivalent rights. Token Functionality and Use by Stakeholder Type The token functionality and use is modeled using the Livepeer and MakerDAO frameworks and is designed to ensure that all participants, acting in their own self-interests, are motivated to (a) maximize the value captured through and by the network; and (b) maintain sustainable network growth. Please note that a party may combine roles for a greater impact within the network.

However, we assume that in the majority of cases, some Guild members will have staked tokens for the loan, so these can be automatically used to pay the governance fee) In the case of apathy of voters [32] (low level of participation in voting), the narrow group of token holders can change fundamental economic parameters of the network according to their own strategy An apathy of staking - where a majority of token holders avoid participation in staking, consequently exposing lenders to more significant risks. This can result in a deficit of lenders in the network. This problem is present primarily at the initial stage of network growth. We propose certain mechanisms, in some cases similar to those used by Livepeer, to incentivise participation in the staking process. The values of and ratios between the stability fee, penalty fee, and infra-network rate may not be adequately established, resulting in system imbalance (which means that at least one of the groups of network participants will be not satisfied by these variables). In such a case, the network growth will be seriously limited. Sybil attacks [33] Malefactors could create fraudulent AFOs and Guilds. These structures can act to undertake activities such as intentional loan default. The Community trust staking mechanics is one of the main protection measures for such attacks. Spam attacks - the creation of a lot of AFOs/Guilds for malicious means. One of the solutions is to freeze a certain amount on tokens for AFO/Guild creation and prevent their withdrawal until the created organization is recognized as honest according to the specific criteria of their members\u2019 activity. 51% attack In the Akropolis ecosystem, the term \u201c51% attack\u201d refers to an attack on governance processes by a conspiracy of >50% of active token holders (or the collection of this number of tokens by one small group). In this case, the attackers can establish variables of economic parameters serving only their own interests, which could destroy sustainable network operation. There are two protection measures: The economic rationality of the attackers - if they destroy the network, they will ultimately lose the value of the tokens Initial token distribution to stakeholders that are interested in network growth.

C2FC (Commitments to Future Cash Flows) [34] A financial primitive that represents the digital right to operate with future cash flows expected to arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (this could be implemented in any blockchain) within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder\u2019s address. Therefore, the future cash flows of any individual, company or service take the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. Governance Framework Autonomous financial organisations work as decentralised autonomous organisations. The governance inside each AFO is different from protocol governance: only AFO members are able to make decisions. There is no need for every autonomous financial organisation to have a token of its own. The Governance Framework provides decision-making support for Autonomous Financial Organisations. The core Governance API supports a number of base level commands, like the registration of a new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution, or allowing new members in. IM (Identity Management) The IM is analogous to the Ethereum Naming Service, which keeps the following records: Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers, e.g. hash with a document copy or IPFS link List of all created AFOs List of all AFO members Guilds (Association of AFOs) [35] [36] Guilds are self-governing structures formed by AFOs as members. Within the Akropolis network, Guilds can be described as something similar to Chambers Of Trade, Business associations or Self-regulated organizations. Basic network variables and definitions Stability fee - a reward for Network Keepers for staking in favor of \"honest\" Guilds (whose members repay debts diligently). This reward is charged as part of the interest rate of a loan. Penalty fee - a penalty, applied in situations of debt default of at least one Guild member to the stakes in their favor. All stakes are equally penalized for a certain percentage of tokens for every default event. Infra-network interest rate [37] - the maximum value of an interest rate that can be applied to a loan. Governance fee - the percentage of a debt that is required to be paid in AKRO tokens which are burned thereafter. Similar to MKR in MakerDAO. Staking - AKRO tokens placed as a risky deposit (commonly known as skin in the game) on a specific smart contract with purpose to perform the \u201cselection\u201d of honest Guilds by collective risk assessment. If the Guild members repay their debt diligently, the person who made a stake receives a reward in the form of a stability fee and, during the growth process additional rewards in AKRO tokens.

Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy. It is designed to: enable anybody regardless of geography to quickly set up, operate and grow informal autonomous financial organisations (AFOs), e.g. digital co-ops, guilds, mutuals enable a previously impossible interoperable scalable network between them and external third parties, whereby value can be exchanged freely in a trust-minimised way (e.g. co-invest, lend/borrow, trade). reduce instances of fraud and misuse of funds What is DeFi? What is your place in DeFi ecosystem? Decentralized finance (#defi) refers to a group of financial sector-focussed startups that leverages open source software and decentralized networks to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that operate without unnecessary intermediaries. DeFi is by far the most promising area of blockchain application, with a number of high-quality interoperable projects promising the future of transparent, fully auditable, efficient peer-to-peer interactions, based both on existing financial primitives and creating novel ways to generate and exchange value. We are building an alternative savings infrastructure that can be tested by informal savings groups (or AFOs) in emerging markets now. What\u2019s the main problem the project solves? Financial security and access to basic financial services without dependence on fractional reserve-based banking system, and therefore resilient to economic crises. The protocol is designed to enable scalability of informal member-owned organizations, that have existed for centuries globally and remain active in emerging markets, especially in Africa, parts of Europe, US and Asia. This is envisaged as an alternative to challenged financial institutions mandated with providing pensions/banking/social insurance and a more resilient alternative to traditional banks that rely on fractional reserve banking. How do you know it is a valid problem with verified demand? The problem of insolvency of centralised pensions and social security institutions is a well documented one. Our summary of external resources is below: Library of press articles here . Documentary \u201cThe Coming Retirement Crisis\u201d by Goldman Sachs\u2019 Raul Pal (our brief video summary is here ) Documentary \u201cThe Pension Gamble\u201d by the Frontline. What\u2019s your competitive advantage? Competitive advantage over other DeFi solutions: validated product-market-fit existing non-speculative target user base clear monetisation model Competitive advantage over fintech solutions and traditional banking: No bank account required DeFi integrations provide for a continuous above-market* savings rate with perfect liquidity No need for long-term lockups to receive interest - continuous interest payment Resistance to fraud or manipulation Provable solvency - no surprise bankruptcies or not being able to access one\u2019s funds Ability to receive funds even if the organization dissolves or fails Scaling potential to co-operative bank model User incentives to grow the network Transparent, real-time, immutable financial record-keeping for every user \u2013 solving fraud and minimizing the misuse of funds through multi-signature fund deployment Easy integration of new financial products due to ethereum interoperability What does the world look like if Akropolis is a success? Unraidable member-owned \u201cpension funds\u201d vs. a state unilaterally raiding public pension funds, like what happened in Argentina, Poland, Venezuela Provably solvent at all times due to transparent and fully auditable smart-contracts vs. a multi-billion-dollar GE pension scheme that is deemed both \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and \u201cimpossible to unravel\u201d Source of social insurance and support vs. reliance on an opaque centralised party What 100x improvement over the status quo do you enable? Imagine, you are approaching retirement age and are counting on a healthy amount to see you through your latter years? Only to discover that after fees, haircuts and forced reductions, the money you were counting on is not there? Because your country is massively in debt and the public funds have been leveraged to pay other debts of the state. And you are not prepared? Having an alternative system that renders such outcome an impossibility by design is an \u221ex improvement to what is expected to be a status quo for many people on a 10-year timeframe. What are informal savings groups (ISG)? Why are they important? Savings groups are member-owned institutions, typically <20 members who save together and take small loans from the common savings pool or invest together and then share profits. Savings Groups are simple, transparent, autonomous and locally run . Members provide their own savings and credit services at negligible cost, while retaining earnings and investment in their own communities. Savings groups have proven to be one of the most effective, low-cost alternative mechanisms to provide basic financial services for people that have difficulties in receiving those services from traditional financial institutions. Informal savings groups and closely linked to diaspora remittances and are an existing element of most emerging markets economies. They are one of the earliest and most robust surviving forms of a de facto autonomous financial organisation. What are autonomous financial organisations (AFO)? Autonomous financial organisations is a term native to the Akropolis protocol used to denote all digital co-ops/guilds, i.e. member-owned organisations that provide financial services such as co-savings and co-investing, access to credit on flexible terms, a basic form of insurance etc. Informal Savings Groups is a real-world form of an AFO. What services are planned to be available for AFOs? Savings accounts, co-investment inside the network, access to low-cost easily accessible credit inside the network, social insurance. Why focus on emerging markets? Real-world use case : mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will first take place in areas with poorly developed legacy financial infrastructure, where cryptocurrency adds real value and is a superior alternative to currently available options. Weak legacy financial infrastructure : dominance of mobile money (e.g. mPesa) for over a decade; relatively advanced digital financial infrastructure. Multi-billion-dollar total addressable market : Informal savings groups hold hundreds of billions of US$, with remittances between diaspora/immigrant communities reaching US$240 bn YoY . Existing behavioural patterns and product-market fit : Without imposing new behavioural patterns on users who have already been operating like this for years, we help informal savings circle leapfrog to member-owned banks by making them scaleable, fraud-proof, and geography-agnostic using the blockchain technology. We see informal economy in Africa, esp. Kenya as an excellent market to verify assumptions and get real user feedback that will help the protocol evolve into a tool for developed markets based on our 10-year outlook (failure of centralised pension funds, failure of depositor protection schemes, cash controls, etc.), which if correct will spawn a new wave of digital member-owned financial organisations as safer, more trustworthy alternatives. Why adopt blockchain technology? Two of our target networks have already decided that they need to move to a blockchain-first infrastructure from their legacy infrastructure which is now >10 years old. The advantages they see is low OpEx, low cost of remittances, resilience to fraud and manipulation, and ability to scale their businesses. On a more general note, a stable financial system relies on trust in the state and private sector financial institutions. In most developed markets, that trust has been lost. In our use case, blockchain technology uniquely enables alternative member-owned financial institutions by providing the following: trust-minimised exchange of value between the parties that do not know or trust each other shared immutable on-chain financial accounting prevents fraud and misuse of funds fully transparent and auditable smart contracts ensure provable solvency. For more details, please see our Wiki FAQ Please elaborate on your token economy? MakerDAO and Livepeer as reference models. For more details, please see our Wiki FAQ . What\u2019s the necessity for token issuing? A native AKRO token is required to enable fiscal governance of the internal network economy and solve for trust in cases of credit issuance between network members. Token issuance is required to ensure wide initial distribution of the token. For more details, please see our Tokenomics Wiki Page . Why not use stablecoin instead of your token? Our protocol has an internal economy. Governance of the internal economy requires an internal token. The token staking and governance approach requires a token whose value is connected to the current network and not tied to other projects and networks. As such, the AKRO token is an essential element of the protocol internal economy and cannot be replaced by an external stablecoin. Our team will continue improving the model through collaboration with the largest blockchain research centre in Europe, University College London, and their token economics research programme, detailed here . Technology Why is there a need to use blockchain and what does it uniquely enable that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible? A stable financial system relies on trust in the state and private sector financial institutions. In most developed markets, that trust has been lost. Blockchain technology uniquely enables alternative member-owned financial institutions by providing the following: trust-minimised exchange of value between the parties that do not know or trust each other shared immutable on-chain financial accounting prevents fraud and misuse of funds fully transparent and auditable smart contracts ensure provable solvency. Will you be building your own blockchain? No, we are not. Designed as a blockchain-agnostic protocol, Akropolis is currently being implemented on Ethereum, the next iteration will be built using Polkadot , with active R&D underway. What is the risk of your solution being affected by Ethereum scalability issues? At the protocol level, speed and immediately finality are not as relevant as being able to guarantee fraud-resistant accounting and solve for trust-minimised exchanges of value between remote parties. Therefore, scalability is not a critical dependency on our roadmap. What are the building blocks of Akropolis protocol? C2FC AFO maintenance and Governance Module Identity Management module Accounting module Network Governance module What is C2FC? Commitments to Future Cashflows (or C2FC) \u2013 a financial primitive that represents a digital right to operate with future cashflow that will arrive in any form to any Ethereum address (now it works in Ethereum, but could be implemented in any blockchain)within a given time frame. Simply put, it looks like a relay: a C2FC issuer must receive payment within this specified period, but those payments are fully or partially forwarded to the C2FC token holder\u2019s address. Therefore, the future cashflow of any individual, company or service takes the form of a measurable digital unit that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral. What is AFO maintenance and Governance Module? AFOs work as decentralised autonomous organisations. The governance inside each AFO is different from a protocol governance as only AFO members are able to make decisions thus there is no need for the internal token in every autonomous financial organisation. AFO maintenance and Governance Module provides decision support for Autonomous Financial Organisations. The core API supports a number of base level commands, like registration of new Autonomous Financial Organisation, making changes to its constitution etc. What is Identity Management Module (IM)? IMS is analogous to Ethereum Naming service, which keep the following records: Registry of all users of the protocol and links to user\u2019s external personal data providers, e.g. hash with a document copy or IPFS link List of all created AFOs List of all created AFO members Do you provide a credit scoring system? No. We do not centrally store protocol user data or provide scoring and risk assessment within the protocol. Any third-party can access pseudo-anonymised transactions on-chain and assess the risk on their own or use third-party data to assess the risk. Off-chain information may be elected to be shared by AFOs in order to get access to competitively-priced credit from external capital providers. As a result, a third-party may combine various opt-in data sources to create an alternative credit scoring system. When Ethereum anonymisation and gas-effective zk-snarks solution is created, we will seek to apply it to the protocol. We continue monitoring the ecosystem, e.g. Aztec protocol.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"old/FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"old/FAQ/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"old/FAQ/#what-is-akropolis","text":"Akropolis is a domain-specific financial protocol dedicated to the needs of the informal economy.

Our scheme is generalised to allow any cryptocurrency to be used with any identifier. We bring simplicity and familiar UX to crypto by allowing people to send and receive crypto (Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, at this stage!) using just their mobile number All you need to send crypto to a friend is her mobile number No need to share your ethereum address over insecure channels like messengers/email/SMS. It\u2019s quick, as easy as Venmo , safe and private (you hold the keys) Problem In order to make a payment over a decentralized network, the user needs to know the recipient\u2019s public key. A public key is a notoriously long set of numbers and letters. It is easy to make a mistake, and copy-pasting isn\u2019t always safe if your device is compromised. As a result, the UX is not intuitive and continues to present a serious hurdle to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. There are notable teams working on addressing that - shoutout to Austin Griffith from BurnerWallet , Ric from Balance.io and Viktor from TrustWallet . What we are proposing below is our solution that can be integrated with the ecosystem wallets, exchanges and dApps to expand their offering and UX. Solution We introduce a NuCypher-based cryptographic scheme, which allows users to send ETH and ERC-20 tokens to a mobile number instead of the recipient\u2019s public key. Our solution has the following features: Convenient and familiar UX : no cognitive burden on users User privacy and self-sovereignty : user controls who can know her Ethereum address. User can only receive payments from pre-approved parties, however their number is uncapped. Generalised and scalable : can be used across many identifiers and any cryptocurrencies any other identifier, e.g. email ID, Whatsapp ID, Telegram ID, Signal ID, WeChat ID, etc. This scheme can be extended to include any cryptocurrency. How it works Register Set settings of access to ethereum address to your friends from the contact list Send tokens and ethereum using a phone number instead of ethereum address. Target Client Base (lib) Wallets and dApp browsers ( Trust wallet , Balance , imToken , etc.) Exchanges ( Binance , Coinbase , Kraken , etc.) dApps ( OpenSea , CryptoKitties , Decentraland , etc.). Tech design A) Database: (KMS-like (Key Management System), could be centralized or decentralized): stores a pair of phone number\u2019s hash and NuCypher public key. B) Storage (could be centralized or decentralized): keeps users' encrypted messages with private information: ethereum address, first name and last name (or nickname). Let\u2019s consider our usual Bob and Alice. 1) When registering Alice performs the following actions: a. encrypts the data (message w/ ethereum address, first name/last name) with its private key and puts it in Storage b. sends its NuCypher public key to Database. 2) Alice sends API request to Database and gets Bob's NuCypher public key. 3) Alice creates a re-encryption key (rekey) >> NuCypher nodes re-encrypt Alice\u2019s data >> Alice puts TreasureMap in Storage. Now Bob can decipher Alice\u2019s data by his private NuCypher key. Please note that actions 2 and 3 can be performed for any number of friends from Alice\u2019s contact list. Then Bob wants to send ETH or ERC-20 tokens to Alice. 4) Bob gets TreasureMap from Storage. 5) Bob deciphers Alice\u2019s data. Now Bob knows Alice\u2019s ethereum address. 6) The application generates a transaction for Alice with the ethereum address from the message as a payee. Thus, users can send each other ETH/ERC-20 using just a mobile number of any other identifier, e.g. email ID, Whatsapp ID, Telegram ID, Signal ID, WeChat ID, etc. This scheme can be extended to include any cryptocurrency. Why NuCypher NuCypher is a decentralized KMS provider based on homomorphic cryptography. Using NuCypher we can achieve a secure transmission of address data and effect transfers between the two parties without disclosing the addresses themselves, thus delivering robust partial anonymisation of transactions. A complete anonymisation can be achieved using ZK-Snarks, Schnorr signatures or ring signatures however this work is outside of the timeframe allowed for this project and may be included in further iterations.

(See earlier IPE article: UK roundup: ONS and Public Sector Pensions Commission ) The report said the government employed a discount rate based on AA-rated corporate bonds instead of index-linked gilts to calculate liabilities, while public sector employers and employees are \"not charged the full current service costs of the liabilities the pension schemes are taking on each year\". It said a \"completely different discount rate\" chosen by the government had been used to compute these. As a result, the commission argued that both employers and employees undervalue the scheme because although they are paying combined contributions of around 20% of salary, the true value based on index-linked gilts is closer to 40% of salary, or even 30% based on long-term gilt returns. It estimated that, in 2010\u201311, using the government's methodology for calculating the annual service cost, these pensions would cost \u00a318.5bn (\u20ac22.2bn), of which \u00a34.5bn would come from the Treasury, or the taxpayer. But the commission said this was an inaccurate measure of the cost, that the figure was closer to \u00a335bn a year and that this is what employers and employees should be paying. Peter Tompkins, fellow of the institute of actuaries and chairman of the commission, said: \"It is a matter both of justice and good economics that public sector employees and employers should bear the full cost of their pension provision as it accrues. \"So long as those contributions are sufficient to pay the public sector pensions of today, the cash flows in and out steadily and in balance. \"Of late, however, the amount the Treasury has to pay to top pensions up has risen and will rise still further into the future. \"Like an unstable Ponzi scheme, it will only work if tomorrow's generations of new members and taxpayers are able to stomach a higher cost to pay tomorrow for the unfunded promises being made today.\" Tompkins added: \"No one change on its own will be enough to control costs if you want to bring costs down to the 20% level people have in mind, rather than a 40% we believe we have shown they are actually costing.\" The commission outlined a number of potential reforms to try and improve transparency and reduce the cost of the public sector pensions to the taxpayer, such as: A reformed defined benefit option to bring costs down to 20% of salary Reducing the accrual rate to 1/80th or switching to a career average scheme could save \u00a310bn a year Increasing pension age to 65 for all members, which would save \u00a35bn a year Reducing index-linking of pensions from Retail Price Inflation (RPI) to Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), which would save 10% of the costs Increasing employer contributions by 2 percentage points, raising \u00a32bn a year Other possibilities considered by the commission included moving to a defined contribution or a hybrid scheme, although the report noted each option for reform had its pros and cons. Tompkins added: \"As Greece has been experiencing, increases to retirement ages or cuts in benefits are not popular at the best of times, but implementing them as part of a package of crisis cuts is the least palatable option of all. \"It is essential reforms be conducted early in a measured way rather than waiting until we have a crisis.\" Tompkins repeatedly said he believed existing benefits should be \"sacrosanct\".

The internet began implementation in 1983. The first smartphone was launched in 1992\u201315 years before the first iPhone drove us all into a frenzy. Following slow starts, these innovations became 'disruptive technologies' that fundamentally changed all aspects of the world around us, including within the pensions industry. And now another emerging technology is expected to have just as much of an impact: Blockchain. About blockchain Blockchain is a \"game changer\" according to Protiviti managing director, IT security and privacy, Ryan Rubin.\"A disruptive technology that fundamentally calls into question many of the industry structures that have been in place for decades, if not centuries.\" Blockchain technology is a new way to process financial transactions. While traditionally these transactions required the use of 'middlemen' to verify the transaction securely (custodian houses and the London Stock Exchange are two such 'middlemen' for example), blockchain removes the need for these intermediaries. The result is transactions can be completed more swiftly and with less 'processes' to go through, which can therefore lower costs. To achieve this, the digital record of a financial transaction is encrypted into a 'block'. A number of blockchain users' computers (as independent entities known as 'blockchain miners') then verify if it is a genuine transaction. If they all approve the transaction the money will be passed from A to B. The 'block' representing that transaction is then bound onto the 'chain' that records the movement of that money using algorithms\u200a\u2014\u200athus creating a continuous, linked list of transactions that provides a secure and unchangeable history of electronic transactions, Equiniti director Paul Sturgess says. Or, to put it simply, EY director Jason Whyte compares it to the old mobile phone game Snake , where every time the snake 'ate' a block on screen, the block got added onto the end of the snake. The details of each transaction/ block are not stored, only the fact that the transaction happened, along with the unique 'digital signature' of that transaction/block, which cannot be converted back into its original form. \"If the original data was altered it would produce a different digital signature that would alert the network to the mismatch,\" Gowling director Liz Wood explains. To put a visual slant on it, imagine someone holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves etc\u200a\u2014\u200aeach block has this 'picture' of all the previous transactions, and the further along the chain, the more repetitions of the 'picture' each block would have. Therefore any tampering would stand out throughout the chain. Also, as the data is distributed to so many computers, it should be much harder for hackers to attack it compared to traditional financial transaction processes. Blockchain's use of multiple peer devices to authorise every transaction means \"it quite simply can't be overridden by one party attempting to manipulate records\", Hames states. Adding to the blockchain's security is the element of tracking and transparency. As there are no 'middlemen' recording the movement of money, the blockchains showing the financial transactions are instead available for everybody to view, via a distributed (or 'shared') ledger. IFDS director of innovation Phil Goffin adds that blockchain provides both investors and financial institutions with the same industry-standard cryptography controls to enable secure communications. This removes trust issues such as identity theft, thus enabling parties to maintain shared ledgers of their economic affairs, he explains. Financial beginnings Blockchain technology was first conceived in 2008 and was implemented in 2009 to be used with the online-only currency (which is a currency that has no gold or silver standard attached to it, no government backing, and is only worth as much as people are prepared to trade for it, also known as a 'cryptocurrency') Bitcoin. So far, the amount of money moved using blockchain amounts to just 0.025 per cent of global GDP, or $20 billion, according to the World Economic Forum. But while the amount is currently small, this is set to grow rapidly, particularly as the financial services industry has started to explore blockchain's potential. There are currently a number of blockchain trials taking place within the financial service industry, such as R3 Cev, which is a consortium of over 40 banks developing the settlement of securities using blockchain and setl.io, a group that is developing an institutional payment solution for the UK banking system. The Bank of England is also leading a trial to replace the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), which sits at the heart of the UK banking system. Also, the Financial Conduct Authority said that it was considering approving a \"small but significant number of firms\", Alpha FMC principal Olivia Vinden says. \"A group of seven banks, including Santander, CIBC and UniCredit were amongst the first financial institutions to move real money across borders using blockchain-based technology,\" she adds. Financial services firms embracing this technology may seem strange, as it has the potential to be an existential risk to entire sections within the industry. \"For some financial companies, blockchain strikes at the heart of your business, if your business model is in managing those assets for people who want to trade them,\" Whyte says. \"But then the question is if you think this is going to cannibalise your industry, are you better to cannibalise it first and build a new business model around it or wait for it to happen to you?\" Vinden agrees that blockchain could represent a risk to those parts of the financial industry that support clearing, settlement and safekeeping. \"However, the possibility to reduce costs as a result of this technology should be seen as an opportunity, rather than a threat,\" she states. For instance, Capita divisional head of marketing and research Robin Hames thinks it could quite easily take off in emerging economies where the financial infrastructure is less developed and less ingrained, so can more easily be overhauled. \"It's the 'advanced' economies themselves in catch up, ironically,\" he adds. Asset management is expected to be the first aspect of the financial services sector to take this opportunity and implement blockchain. Alternative assets in particular are normally quite illiquid, but blockchain could help turn them into more tradeable assets, Whyte predicts. Pensions' explorations So it is not surprising that the financial services sector is among the first to see if the benefits of blockchain can be utilised beyond the movement of online currencies. But what may be more surprising is that its potential within pensions is already being explored. Dutch pensions manager APG recently announced that it has earmarked a significant part of its innovation budget for the coming years for working alongside other companies to explore the practical applications of blockchain. The California Public Employees' Retirement Systems (CalPERS), the largest public pension fund in the US, has also discussed the possibility of investing in blockchain technology, while reports have emerged that the Chinese government will soon start using blockchain technology to process social security payments. Even the UK's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is in the process of a three- to six-month blockchain trial, which began in May this year, with up to 24 participants. This is conducted by a private sector company, that handles the claimant's data independently from government. \"This is a small scale, voluntary trial. There are no restrictions or limits on how welfare payments are spent for those involved in the trial and all personal information is removed before the data reaches DWP,\" its spokesperson states. Industry uses Within the pensions industry itself, people are beginning to consider the benefits blockchain could provide. According to BTL Group founder and CEO Guy Halford-Thompson, \"for industries, such as pensions, which have suffered from a lack of transparency in the past, there is a huge opportunity to transform the industry with a small amount of investment in blockchain technology\". State Street head of UK pensions and banks, asset owner solutions, Andy Todd thinks it will initially impact the most 'inefficient' areas of the pensions industry, such as those that are manual, require a lot of stakeholders to engage, align and sign-off, or have intermediaries that add cost to the system. Certainly smoothing the many layers within the pensions industry generally could be beneficial to savers. Currently, the pension fund member is connected to a set of underlying assets via pension fund managers, asset managers, brokers and investment funds. Blockchain technology offers the prospect of sweeping away a lot of this complexity and frictional cost, Rubin says. \"For example, how long does it currently take the industry to undertake a pension fund transfer? Typically several months. To a customer who is already getting used to the fact that they can transfer money reliably between bank accounts now in a matter of minutes via Faster Payments, the length of this delay is difficult for the industry to explain. Blockchain technology could bring this time down to a matter of minutes if implemented correctly,\" he explains. The greater transparency of ownership of pension fund assets could make well-performing funds more attractive to buyers, therefore helping generate better investment decisions overall, Rubin adds. Blockchain technology could also instigate the use of 'smart contracts', where the technology has rules built in to automate simple transactions when certain conditions are met (such as a market fluctuation or a pension saver reaching a certain age). This would offer greater transparency on payments/fees/ allocation of funds and shorten the time taken to complete transactions. Blockchain's ability to 'link' financial transactions together could also be a valuable mechanism for recording an individual's pension savings. \"Instead of having a new pension every time I go to a new employer, the record of my pension and the contributions paid in may be added to my one blockchain, despite the different employers throughout my working life paying into my pension. And as it cannot be modified, we will always know that it is an accurate record,\" Whyte says. Blockchain could then also have a role in the secondary annuity market where initial and ultimate beneficiaries will change over time, Sturgess adds. It is important to note that blockchain technology has the potential for recording and linking any data, not just financial, meaning its uses within the pensions industry could extend beyond finance to administration. For instance, blockchain could be used to improve upon pensions communications. If a member had several pots with various providers, that information could be pooled into a blockchain so as to form an overall position of the member's pensions savings, Wood states. The industry is currently in the process of implementing a pensions dashboard to enable people to see all their savings in one place, so it would not be surprising if this area was an early adopter of blockchain within the pensions industry, Hames adds. Documents such as member records, scheme documents, service contracts and accounts could be kept and updated through blockchain. All parties would be able to view the same information, so the problem of version control would disappear, Pensions Administration Standards Association chairman Margaret Snowdon says. Blockchain may become a powerful weapon against pension liberation fraud, due to the increased transparency it provides. Data could also be included within the blockchain to confirm whether advice has been taken before the money is transferred to the saver, Snowdon adds. \"From a financial advice perspective it would be great to be able to hand over an accurate record of a pensions holdings and have a financial adviser view that blockchain very rapidly to get a view of what they have got and might need,\" Whyte says. He adds that \"you can imagine the government being quite interested in blockchain for tax records\". Hames agrees that it would be \"tremendously useful\" for regulators and auditors who struggle with reconciliation activities, which could be done automatically. \"A very prescient example would be the current GMP reconciliation requirements, which will exorcise the minds and time of administrators and trustees alike for the next couple of years,\" he says. \"Imagine how less painful, or frankly unnecessary, this work would be had a shared, validated ledger existed.\" Risks So already the industry is imagining blockchain technology having a wide number of benefits for the sector. Imagination is a wonderful thing. But could the reality be not so pretty? Despite blockchain still being a new technology, and the security it provides much heralded, it has already been subject to hacks. For instance, recent attacks on digital currency exchanges DAO and Bitfinex saw over $50 million taken. Re Business Blockchain author William Mougayar states that while security is an inherent feature of blockchains, a blockchain application could be badly written and have security holes, \"just as a web application could have security weaknesses too\". Breaches so far seem to be exploiting the trouble users have protecting their online currency (as they are generally stored in digital files) instead of the distributed ledger system of blockchains itself being compromised. But the whole 'newness' of the technology could also be an issue. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is a group of US regulators, has already warned that \"operational vulnerabilities [with blockchain] may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale\". A teething problem that has already occurred, Whyte notes, is when two transactions happen at roughly the same time, which can result in a short period of time where a blockchain has two chains until the 'real' chain is established. Another issue is that the technology is changing very quickly. For instance, Accenture has just taken out a controversial patent on a technology that lets them edit a blockchain. A key part of blockchain's security is that it cannot be tampered with, but the argument for this patent is that it would provide a cleaner way to undo a mistake, such as if someone made a 'fat finger trade' and added an extra '0' onto a transaction, Whyte explains. The evolving nature of the new technology also generates a risk around standardisation and cooperation. \"As the technology is still evolving it is possible that we could end up with a VHS versus Betamax situation,\" Sturgess warns, \"where both technologies were technically excellent for the purpose, but ultimately it was disagreement regarding standards and licenses that allowed VHS to dominate the market.\" Reluctance There is also a risk that the pensions industry itself may be reluctant to utilise blockchain technology. As is often the case with technology advances, legacy systems are the biggest barrier to implementation. It really required online banking to take hold before many in pensions were prepared to embrace the digital channel, Hames states. \"And let's be honest, there are still plenty of schemes that are well behind the online curve, let alone exploring blockchain,\" he adds. To counter this, Snowdon recommends the creation of a technology forum for the pensions industry. But in the meantime, it seems unlikely the pensions industry would want to risk putting pension fund members savings in cutting-edge technology. While the technology is still being developed and is not yet being widely used by banks, a court may not look favourably on a trustee who invested in a company using blockchain if this resulted in the loss of pension scheme money, Wood warns. And while blockchain may have benefits for the pensions sector, and could reduce some inefficiency, it will not be a panacea to all the industry's problems. For instance, it will not provide insight as to where money should be invested to achieve positive returns with low volatility. It will not stop human error, such the wrong amounts being put into the system. And it will not address the need for people save more for retirement and engage with those savings. Overhype? So as it is certainly not a 'cure all', does that mean blockchain technology is overhyped? \"It is approaching the peak of Gartner's Hype Curve,\" Sturgess states, \"and as such will soon drop into the wonderfully-named 'trough of disillusionment', at which point many early-stage companies are likely to fail and the market will become frustrated by the lack of useable products and tangible benefits. The technology companies will then start to consolidate and prepare for mainstream adoption as clearer business use cases start to emerge.\" It has to be remembered that the technology is still very new. Currently, blockchain is being compared to the internet in the 1990s, where the first internet sites looked and behaved more like traditional shops until people became used to the new technology and its applications. As it still early days for the technology, no doubt blockchain will see a number of false starts. But when considering if and when blockchain will have an impact on the pension sector, it is worth mulling over the words of a man at the heart of many technological innovations\u200a\u2014\u200aBill Gates. He has stated: \"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.\" Written by Laura Blows [Download the PDF here ] For additional information about Akropolis, please reach out to team@akropolis.io .","title":"New kid on the block"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#new-kid-on-the-block","text":"The first computer was created back in 1946. The internet began implementation in 1983. The first smartphone was launched in 1992\u201315 years before the first iPhone drove us all into a frenzy.

And now another emerging technology is expected to have just as much of an impact: Blockchain.","title":"New kid on the block"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#about-blockchain","text":"Blockchain is a \"game changer\" according to Protiviti managing director, IT security and privacy, Ryan Rubin.\"A disruptive technology that fundamentally calls into question many of the industry structures that have been in place for decades, if not centuries.\" Blockchain technology is a new way to process financial transactions. While traditionally these transactions required the use of 'middlemen' to verify the transaction securely (custodian houses and the London Stock Exchange are two such 'middlemen' for example), blockchain removes the need for these intermediaries. The result is transactions can be completed more swiftly and with less 'processes' to go through, which can therefore lower costs. To achieve this, the digital record of a financial transaction is encrypted into a 'block'. A number of blockchain users' computers (as independent entities known as 'blockchain miners') then verify if it is a genuine transaction. If they all approve the transaction the money will be passed from A to B. The 'block' representing that transaction is then bound onto the 'chain' that records the movement of that money using algorithms\u200a\u2014\u200athus creating a continuous, linked list of transactions that provides a secure and unchangeable history of electronic transactions, Equiniti director Paul Sturgess says. Or, to put it simply, EY director Jason Whyte compares it to the old mobile phone game Snake , where every time the snake 'ate' a block on screen, the block got added onto the end of the snake. The details of each transaction/ block are not stored, only the fact that the transaction happened, along with the unique 'digital signature' of that transaction/block, which cannot be converted back into its original form. \"If the original data was altered it would produce a different digital signature that would alert the network to the mismatch,\" Gowling director Liz Wood explains. To put a visual slant on it, imagine someone holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves holding a picture of themselves etc\u200a\u2014\u200aeach block has this 'picture' of all the previous transactions, and the further along the chain, the more repetitions of the 'picture' each block would have. Therefore any tampering would stand out throughout the chain. Also, as the data is distributed to so many computers, it should be much harder for hackers to attack it compared to traditional financial transaction processes. Blockchain's use of multiple peer devices to authorise every transaction means \"it quite simply can't be overridden by one party attempting to manipulate records\", Hames states. Adding to the blockchain's security is the element of tracking and transparency. As there are no 'middlemen' recording the movement of money, the blockchains showing the financial transactions are instead available for everybody to view, via a distributed (or 'shared') ledger. IFDS director of innovation Phil Goffin adds that blockchain provides both investors and financial institutions with the same industry-standard cryptography controls to enable secure communications. This removes trust issues such as identity theft, thus enabling parties to maintain shared ledgers of their economic affairs, he explains.","title":"About blockchain"},{"location":"old/library/2016 New kid on the block/#financial-beginnings","text":"Blockchain technology was first conceived in 2008 and was implemented in 2009 to be used with the online-only currency (which is a currency that has no gold or silver standard attached to it, no government backing, and is only worth as much as people are prepared to trade for it, also known as a 'cryptocurrency') Bitcoin. So far, the amount of money moved using blockchain amounts to just 0.025 per cent of global GDP, or $20 billion, according to the World Economic Forum. But while the amount is currently small, this is set to grow rapidly, particularly as the financial services industry has started to explore blockchain's potential. There are currently a number of blockchain trials taking place within the financial service industry, such as R3 Cev, which is a consortium of over 40 banks developing the settlement of securities using blockchain and setl.io, a group that is developing an institutional payment solution for the UK banking system. The Bank of England is also leading a trial to replace the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), which sits at the heart of the UK banking system.

Image Credit: Richard Allen Pressure is mounting on the Government to oversee a root-and-branch overhaul of Britain's company pension schemes in which more than 11 million workers have savings. It comes as these \"final salary\" schemes are registering their biggest ever funding shortfall, now at almost \u00a31 trillion (\u00a31,000bn). This sum is the gap between the investments these pension schemes own and the likely eventual cost of the pensions they have already promised to pay. Unless solutions are found, experts warn, many hundreds of schemes are likely to fold into the Pension Protection Fund, the lifeboat scheme which provides reduced pension payouts for retired workers caught up in cash-strapped schemes. Trying to force an employer to pay every last penny of promised pension may be counter-productive. We do not want to make the 'best' the enemy of the 'good' \u200a\u2014\u200a Baroness Altmann, former Pensions Minister And while that may be bad news for scheme members, there will be difficulties faced by employers, too, as their ability to invest in current staff and future growth is hampered by a requirement to continually top up a burdensome pension scheme. Increasingly, savers may be required to give up some of their benefits in a compromise deal. For example, firms could promise to pay them more than they might obtain through a PPF rescue \u200a\u2014 \u200abut less than they are entitled to in the letter of their contract. This is something the former pensions minister Baroness (Ros) Altmann, among others, is pushing for. The problem is about to be subject to two major reviews, including one by the influential Work & Pensions Committee of MPs. The outcomes are likely to result in further support for similar compromise measures. What will it mean for workers who depend on these schemes to deliver valuable retirement incomes? Source: Telegraph The pensions at risk are those that promise to pay a set income in retirement, linked to workers' wages and length of service. They are known as final salary or \"defined benefit\" schemes. While few workers contribute to them today, millions have entitlements built up in the past, when the arrangements were common. There are 6,000 such schemes, attached to all types of business. Currently 5,000 are in deficit. The PPF works out a deficit figure based on how much money would be needed to provide the lower level of pension payouts that members would get if the PPF had to step in and rescue the scheme. That figure is currently \u00a3383bn. It is, however, a far smaller shortfall figure than would result if schemes were to pay out everything as promised. This is put at \u00a3935bn, according to consultants Hymans Robertson. These numbers are the worst they've ever been. This is because, when working out shortfalls, pension trustees look at their assets and future liabilities and then apply a likely rate of investment return. Because investment returns are currently excruciatingly low, the shortfalls have expanded. What happens today when a company can't pay for pensions? When a company that operates a final salary pension scheme fails, there is an assessment as to whether the scheme can meet its promises. If not, it eventually passes to the PPF, which manages the assets of the scheme and pays out to pensioners according to its rules and limits. Under the PPF rules the majority of already retired members of the scheme will continue to be paid as normal. Most yet-to-retire members will get 90pc of what they were promised. Certain groups\u200a \u2014\u200a such as those who retire early or those with big pensions\u200a \u2014\u200a might get less. What form could a compromise take? Problems arise when companies are not yet insolvent but are still encumbered with schemes whose deficits are huge. \"The problem with the system as it is today is that too often trustees and their advisers have not used the flexibilities that already exist, so there are binary outcomes,\" said Baroness Altmann, who campaigns on behalf of members of these schemes. \"The company either commits to meeting 100pc of its pension promises, or the PPF takes over.\" She said there were practical solutions that businesses could adopt to reduce the burden. These include merging small schemes to cut costs and switching the pledge to pay inflation-linked annual increases from a higher to a lower measure of inflation\u200a\u2014\u200asomething that has been implemented across public sector pensions but which some private sector schemes are unable to do without a change in legislation.Please visit the Source content for a functional calculator. Link at the end of this article. Source: Telegraph \u200b Jonathan Repp of Mercer, a pensions consultancy, is among those who think shortfalls could be narrowed by moving funds' underlying investments away from government bonds\u200a\u2014\u200asomething that he argues could reduce risk, too . Far more radical would be arrangements under which savers agreed through negotiations with the company behind the scheme to accept payouts that were less than promised, but still better than those offered by the PPF. Such a fix was recently mooted for savers in the British Steel scheme. Joanne Segars, the head of the Pensions & Lifetime Savings Association, which represents pension schemes, said of this suggestion: \"It is inconceivable that the Government can consider these changes for the British Steel scheme without also considering amendments for all schemes.\" Baroness Altmann is also fiercely opposed to the idea that individual schemes get \"special treatment\", wanting instead agreed procedures that could apply to all. \"There is some flexibility in the system as it exists,\" she said. \"But where reform is needed it should apply across the board. \"Any reform will inevitably be difficult, because retirees might complain that they are not being paid the exact amount promised.

It comes as these \"final salary\" schemes are registering their biggest ever funding shortfall, now at almost \u00a31 trillion (\u00a31,000bn). This sum is the gap between the investments these pension schemes own and the likely eventual cost of the pensions they have already promised to pay. Unless solutions are found, experts warn, many hundreds of schemes are likely to fold into the Pension Protection Fund, the lifeboat scheme which provides reduced pension payouts for retired workers caught up in cash-strapped schemes. Trying to force an employer to pay every last penny of promised pension may be counter-productive. We do not want to make the 'best' the enemy of the 'good' \u200a\u2014\u200a Baroness Altmann, former Pensions Minister And while that may be bad news for scheme members, there will be difficulties faced by employers, too, as their ability to invest in current staff and future growth is hampered by a requirement to continually top up a burdensome pension scheme. Increasingly, savers may be required to give up some of their benefits in a compromise deal. For example, firms could promise to pay them more than they might obtain through a PPF rescue \u200a\u2014 \u200abut less than they are entitled to in the letter of their contract. This is something the former pensions minister Baroness (Ros) Altmann, among others, is pushing for. The problem is about to be subject to two major reviews, including one by the influential Work & Pensions Committee of MPs. The outcomes are likely to result in further support for similar compromise measures. What will it mean for workers who depend on these schemes to deliver valuable retirement incomes? Source: Telegraph The pensions at risk are those that promise to pay a set income in retirement, linked to workers' wages and length of service. They are known as final salary or \"defined benefit\" schemes. While few workers contribute to them today, millions have entitlements built up in the past, when the arrangements were common. There are 6,000 such schemes, attached to all types of business. Currently 5,000 are in deficit. The PPF works out a deficit figure based on how much money would be needed to provide the lower level of pension payouts that members would get if the PPF had to step in and rescue the scheme. That figure is currently \u00a3383bn. It is, however, a far smaller shortfall figure than would result if schemes were to pay out everything as promised. This is put at \u00a3935bn, according to consultants Hymans Robertson. These numbers are the worst they've ever been. This is because, when working out shortfalls, pension trustees look at their assets and future liabilities and then apply a likely rate of investment return. Because investment returns are currently excruciatingly low, the shortfalls have expanded.","title":"The \u00a31 trillion pension crisis facing 11m (and they&#39;re the lucky ones)"},{"location":"old/library/2016 The 1 trillion pension crisis facing 11m/#what-happens-today-when-a-company-cant-pay-for-pensions","text":"When a company that operates a final salary pension scheme fails, there is an assessment as to whether the scheme can meet its promises.

Total plan assets as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $3.19 trillion, down from $3.24 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends (generally June 30, 2015). However, market performance since the last fiscal year ends has been strong, and we estimate that aggregate plan assets have jumped to $3.44 trillion as of June 30, 2017. We estimate that the plans experienced a median annualized return on assets of 11.49% in the period between their fiscal year ends and June 30, 2017. The Total Pension Liability reported at the last fiscal year ends totaled $4.72 trillion, up from $4.43 trillion as of the prior fiscal year ends. We estimate that the Total Pension Liability has increased to $4.87 trillion as of June 30, 2017. The aggregate underfunding as of the last fiscal year ends stood at $1.53 trillion, but we estimate that the underfunding has narrowed to $1.43 trillion as of June 30, 2017. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Meanwhile, 32% of the top 100 plans were less than 60% funded. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Of course, the discussion gets far more interesting when Milliman analyzes the prevailing discount rates used by public pensions compared to independent analyses of where those discount rates should be set. As our readers are well aware, we've long argued that public pension funds essentially hide their true funding status by simply choosing artificially high discount rates for future liabilities thus making their present values appear lower than they actually are. It's a clever scam but one that can only persist until the ponzi runs out of cash. As Milliman notes, the median expected return of the 100 largest public pension funds in the U.S. is somewhere around 5.9% based on the asset allocations of those funds. Source: ZeroHedge \u200b Source: ZeroHedge So, what does that mean? Well, Milliman figures that overstating a fund's discount rate by just 1% artificially reduces it's benefit liability by up to 15%. Therefore, given that the aggregate liabilities of the top 100 funds are roughly $5 trillion, each 1% adds about $750 billion in liabilities. A relatively small change in the discount rate can have a significant impact on the Total Pension Liability. How big that impact is depends on the makeup of the plan's membership: a less \"mature\" plan with more active members than retirees typically has a higher sensitivity to interest rate changes than a more mature plan with a bigger retiree population. Other factors, such as automatic cost of living features, also come into play in determining a plan's sensitivity. Using a discount rate that is loo basis points higher or lower than the independently determined investment return assumption moves the aggregate recalibrated Total Pension Liability by anywhere from 8% to 15% (see Figure 13).

Coomer used to work at the McDonnell Douglas plant in Tulsa before it closed in 1994.

(Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b TULSA\u200a \u2014 Tom Coomer has retired twice: once when he was 65, and then several years ago. Each time he realized that with just a Social Security check, \"You can hardly make it these days.\" So here he is at 79, working full-time at Walmart. During each eight-hour shift, he stands at the store entrance greeting customers, telling a joke and fetching a \"buggy.\" Or he is stationed at the exit, checking receipts and the shoppers that trip the theft alarm. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he said during a break. Diagnosed with spinal stenosis in his back, he recently forwarded a doctor's note to managers. \"They got me a stool.\" The way major U.S. companies provide for retiring workers has been shifting for about three decades, with more dropping traditional pensions every year. The first full generation of workers to retire since this turn offers a sobering preview of a labor force more and more dependent on their own savings for retirement. Years ago, Coomer and his co-workers at the Tulsa plant of McDonnell Douglas, the famed airplane maker, were enrolled in the company pension, but in 1994, with an eye toward cutting retirement costs, the company closed the plant. Now, The Washington Post found in a review of those 998 workers, that even though most of them found new jobs, they could never replace their lost pension benefits and many are facing financial struggles in their old age: 1 in 7 has in their retirement years filed for bankruptcy, faced liens for delinquent bills, or both, according to public records. Those affected are buried by debts incurred for credit cards, used cars, health care and sometimes, the college educations of their children. Some have lost their homes. And for many of them, even as they reach beyond 70, real retirement is elusive. Although they worked for decades at McDonnell Douglas, many of the septuagenarians are still working, some full-time. Lavern Combs, 73, works the midnight shift loading trucks for a company that delivers for Amazon. Ruby Oakley, 74, is a crossing guard. Charles Glover, 70, is a cashier at Dollar General. Willie Sells, 74, is a barber. Leon Ray, 76, buys and sells junk. \"I planned to retire years ago,\" Sells says from behind his barber's chair, where he works five days a week. He once had a job in quality control at the aircraft maker and was employed there 29 years. \"I thought McDonnell Douglas was a blue-chip company\u200a that's what I used to tell people. 'They're a hip company and they're not going to close.' But then they left town\u200a \u2014 \u200aand here I am still working. Thank God I had a couple of clippers.\" Likewise, Oakley, a crossing guard at an elementary school, said she took the job to supplement her Social Security. \"It pays some chump change\u200a \u2014 \u200a$7 an hour,\" Oakley said. She has told local officials they should pay better. \"I use it for gas money. I like the people. But we have to get out there in the traffic, and the people at the city think they're doing the senior citizens a favor by letting them work like this.\" Glover works the cash register and stocks goods at a Dollar General store outside Tulsa to make ends meet. After working 27 years at McDonnell Douglas, Glover found work at a Whirlpool factory, and then at another place that makes robots for inspecting welding, and also picked up some jobs doing \u00adcomputer-aided \u00addesign. \"I hope I can quit working in a few years, but the way it looks right now, I can't see being able to,\" Glover said recently between customers. \"I had to refinance my home after McDonnell Douglas closed. I still owe about 12 years of mortgage payments.\" For some, financial shortfalls have grown acute enough that they have precipitated liens for delinquent bills or led people to file for bankruptcy. None were inclined to talk about their debts. \"It's a struggle, just say that,\" said one woman, 72, who filed for bankruptcy in 2013. \"You just try to get by.\"Charles Glover, 70, on Nov. 16 at the Dollar General in Catoosa, Okla.

(Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b A perk that became too costly The notion of pensions \u200a\u2014 \u200aand the idea that companies should set aside money for retirees\u200a \u2014 \u200adidn't last long. They really caught on in the mid-20th century, but today, except among government employers, the traditional pension seems destined to be an artifact of U.S. labor history. The first ones offered by a private company were those handed out by American Express, back when it was a stagecoach delivery service. That was in 1875. The idea didn't exactly spread like wildfire, but under union pressure in the middle of the last century, many companies adopted a plan. By the 1980s, the trend had profoundly reshaped retirement for Americans, with a large majority of full-time workers at medium and large companies getting traditional pension coverage, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Then corporate America changed: Union membership waned. Executive boards, under pressure from financial raiders, focused more intently on maximizing stock prices. And Americans lived longer, making a pension much more expensive to provide. In 1950, a 65-year-old man could be expected to reach age 78, on average. Today, that \u00ad65-year-old is expected to live beyond 84. The extended life expectancy means pension plans must pay out substantially longer than they once did. Exactly what led corporate America away from pensions is a matter of debate among scholars, but there is little question that they seem destined for extinction, at least in the private sector. Even as late as the early 1990s, about 60 percent of full-time workers at medium and large companies had pension coverage, according to the government figures. But today, only about 24 percent of workers at midsize and large companies have pension coverage, according to the data, and that number is expected to continue to fall as older workers exit the workforce. In place of pensions, companies and investment advisers urge employees to open retirement accounts. The basic idea is workers will manage their own retirement funds, sometimes with a little help from their employers, sometimes not. Once they reach retirement age, those accounts are supposed to supplement whatever Social Security might pay. (Today, Social Security provides only enough for a bare-bones budget, about $14,000 a year on average.) The trouble with expecting workers to save on their own is that almost half of U.S. families have no such retirement account, according the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer \u00adFinances. Of those who do have retirement accounts, moreover, their savings are far too scant to support a typical retirement. The median account, among workers at the median income level, is about $25,000. \"The U.S. retirement system, and the workers and retirees it was designed to help, face major challenges,\" according to an October report by the Government Accountability Office. \"Traditional pensions have become much less common, and individuals are increasingly responsible for planning and managing their own retirement savings accounts.\" The GAO further warned that \"many households are ill-equipped for this task and have little or no retirement savings.\" The GAO recommended that Congress consider creating an independent commission to study the U.S. retirement system. \"If no action is taken, a retirement crisis could be looming,\" it said.Coomer makes a pot of coffee at his home in Wagoner after a day of work at Walmart. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he says of working eight-hour shifts with the condition spinal stenosis. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b 'We were stunned' Employees at McDonnell Douglas in the early '90s enjoyed one of the more generous types of pensions, those known as \"30 and out.\" Employees with 30 years on the job could retire with a full pension once they reached age 55. But, as the employees would later learn, the generosity of those pensions made them, in lean times, an appealing target for cost-cutters. Those lean times for McDonnell Douglas began in earnest in the early '90s. Some plants closed. But for the remaining employees, including those at the Tulsa plant, executives said, there was hope: If Congress allowed the multibillion-dollar sale of 72 F-15s to Saudi Arabia, the new business would rescue the company. In fact, the company said in its 1991 annual report, it would save 7,000 jobs. To help win approval for the sale, Tulsa employees wrote letters to politicians. They held a rally with local politicians and the governor of Oklahoma. Eventually, in September 1992, President George H.W. Bush approved the sale. It seemed the Tulsa plant had weathered the storm. The headline in the Oklahoman, one of the state's largest newspapers, proclaimed: \"F-15 Sale to Saudi Arabia Saves Jobs of Tulsa Workers.\" But it hadn't. Within months, executives at the company again turned to cost-cutting. They considered closing a plant in Florida, another in Mesa, Ariz., or the Tulsa facility. Tulsa, it was noted, had the oldest hourly employees \u200a\u2014\u200a the average employee was 51 and had worked there for about 20 years. Many were close to getting a full pension, and that meant closing it would yield bigger savings in retirement costs. \"One day in December '93 they came on the loudspeaker and said, 'Attention, employees,' Coomer recalled. \"We were going to close. We were stunned. Just ran around like a bunch of chickens.\" A few years later, McDonnell Douglas, which continued to struggle, merged with Boeing. But the employees had taken their case to court, and in 2001, a federal judge agreed McDonnell Douglas had illegally considered the pensions in its decision to close the plant. The employees' case, presented by attorneys Joe Farris and Mike Mulder, showed the company had tracked pension savings in its plant closure decisions. The judge found McDonnell Douglas, moreover, had offered misleading testimony in its defense of the plant closing. The judge, Sven Erik Holmes, blasted the company for a \"corporate culture of mendacity.\" Employees eventually won settlements\u200a \u2014 \u200aabout $30,000 was typical. It helped carry people over to find new jobs. But the amount was limited to cover the benefits of three years of employment \u200a\u2014 \u200aand it was far less than the loss in pension and retiree health benefits. Because their pension benefits accrued most quickly near retirement age, the pensions they receive are only a small fraction of what they would have had they worked until full eligibility. \"People went to work at these places thinking they'll work there their whole lives,\" Farris said, noting that the pensions held great appeal to the staff. \"Their trust and loyalty, though, was not reciprocated.\"Ray walks through a collection of junk that he recycles at his home in Claremore. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b Dreaming of work The economic effects were, of course, immediate. The workers, most of them over 50, had to find jobs. Some enrolled in classes for new skills, but then struggled to find jobs in their new fields. They wondered, amid rejections, whether younger workers were favored. Several found jobs at other industrial plants. One started a chicken farm for Tyson. Another took a job on a ranch breaking horses. The Post acquired a list of the 998 employees, reviewed public records for them and interviewed more than 25. Of those interviewed, all found work of one kind or another. Yet all but a handful said their new wages were only about half of what they had been making. Typically, their pay dropped in half, from about $20 per hour to $10 per hour. The pay cut was tough, and it made saving for retirement close to impossible. In fact, it has made retirement itself near impossible for some\u200a \u2014 \u200athey must work to pay the bills.

(Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b TULSA\u200a \u2014 Tom Coomer has retired twice: once when he was 65, and then several years ago. Each time he realized that with just a Social Security check, \"You can hardly make it these days.\" So here he is at 79, working full-time at Walmart. During each eight-hour shift, he stands at the store entrance greeting customers, telling a joke and fetching a \"buggy.\" Or he is stationed at the exit, checking receipts and the shoppers that trip the theft alarm. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he said during a break. Diagnosed with spinal stenosis in his back, he recently forwarded a doctor's note to managers. \"They got me a stool.\" The way major U.S. companies provide for retiring workers has been shifting for about three decades, with more dropping traditional pensions every year. The first full generation of workers to retire since this turn offers a sobering preview of a labor force more and more dependent on their own savings for retirement. Years ago, Coomer and his co-workers at the Tulsa plant of McDonnell Douglas, the famed airplane maker, were enrolled in the company pension, but in 1994, with an eye toward cutting retirement costs, the company closed the plant. Now, The Washington Post found in a review of those 998 workers, that even though most of them found new jobs, they could never replace their lost pension benefits and many are facing financial struggles in their old age: 1 in 7 has in their retirement years filed for bankruptcy, faced liens for delinquent bills, or both, according to public records. Those affected are buried by debts incurred for credit cards, used cars, health care and sometimes, the college educations of their children. Some have lost their homes. And for many of them, even as they reach beyond 70, real retirement is elusive. Although they worked for decades at McDonnell Douglas, many of the septuagenarians are still working, some full-time. Lavern Combs, 73, works the midnight shift loading trucks for a company that delivers for Amazon. Ruby Oakley, 74, is a crossing guard. Charles Glover, 70, is a cashier at Dollar General. Willie Sells, 74, is a barber. Leon Ray, 76, buys and sells junk. \"I planned to retire years ago,\" Sells says from behind his barber's chair, where he works five days a week. He once had a job in quality control at the aircraft maker and was employed there 29 years. \"I thought McDonnell Douglas was a blue-chip company\u200a that's what I used to tell people. 'They're a hip company and they're not going to close.' But then they left town\u200a \u2014 \u200aand here I am still working. Thank God I had a couple of clippers.\" Likewise, Oakley, a crossing guard at an elementary school, said she took the job to supplement her Social Security. \"It pays some chump change\u200a \u2014 \u200a$7 an hour,\" Oakley said. She has told local officials they should pay better. \"I use it for gas money. I like the people. But we have to get out there in the traffic, and the people at the city think they're doing the senior citizens a favor by letting them work like this.\" Glover works the cash register and stocks goods at a Dollar General store outside Tulsa to make ends meet. After working 27 years at McDonnell Douglas, Glover found work at a Whirlpool factory, and then at another place that makes robots for inspecting welding, and also picked up some jobs doing \u00adcomputer-aided \u00addesign. \"I hope I can quit working in a few years, but the way it looks right now, I can't see being able to,\" Glover said recently between customers. \"I had to refinance my home after McDonnell Douglas closed. I still owe about 12 years of mortgage payments.\" For some, financial shortfalls have grown acute enough that they have precipitated liens for delinquent bills or led people to file for bankruptcy. None were inclined to talk about their debts. \"It's a struggle, just say that,\" said one woman, 72, who filed for bankruptcy in 2013. \"You just try to get by.\"Charles Glover, 70, on Nov. 16 at the Dollar General in Catoosa, Okla.

(Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b A perk that became too costly The notion of pensions \u200a\u2014 \u200aand the idea that companies should set aside money for retirees\u200a \u2014 \u200adidn't last long. They really caught on in the mid-20th century, but today, except among government employers, the traditional pension seems destined to be an artifact of U.S. labor history. The first ones offered by a private company were those handed out by American Express, back when it was a stagecoach delivery service. That was in 1875. The idea didn't exactly spread like wildfire, but under union pressure in the middle of the last century, many companies adopted a plan. By the 1980s, the trend had profoundly reshaped retirement for Americans, with a large majority of full-time workers at medium and large companies getting traditional pension coverage, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Then corporate America changed: Union membership waned. Executive boards, under pressure from financial raiders, focused more intently on maximizing stock prices. And Americans lived longer, making a pension much more expensive to provide. In 1950, a 65-year-old man could be expected to reach age 78, on average. Today, that \u00ad65-year-old is expected to live beyond 84. The extended life expectancy means pension plans must pay out substantially longer than they once did. Exactly what led corporate America away from pensions is a matter of debate among scholars, but there is little question that they seem destined for extinction, at least in the private sector. Even as late as the early 1990s, about 60 percent of full-time workers at medium and large companies had pension coverage, according to the government figures. But today, only about 24 percent of workers at midsize and large companies have pension coverage, according to the data, and that number is expected to continue to fall as older workers exit the workforce. In place of pensions, companies and investment advisers urge employees to open retirement accounts. The basic idea is workers will manage their own retirement funds, sometimes with a little help from their employers, sometimes not. Once they reach retirement age, those accounts are supposed to supplement whatever Social Security might pay. (Today, Social Security provides only enough for a bare-bones budget, about $14,000 a year on average.) The trouble with expecting workers to save on their own is that almost half of U.S. families have no such retirement account, according the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer \u00adFinances. Of those who do have retirement accounts, moreover, their savings are far too scant to support a typical retirement. The median account, among workers at the median income level, is about $25,000. \"The U.S. retirement system, and the workers and retirees it was designed to help, face major challenges,\" according to an October report by the Government Accountability Office. \"Traditional pensions have become much less common, and individuals are increasingly responsible for planning and managing their own retirement savings accounts.\" The GAO further warned that \"many households are ill-equipped for this task and have little or no retirement savings.\" The GAO recommended that Congress consider creating an independent commission to study the U.S. retirement system. \"If no action is taken, a retirement crisis could be looming,\" it said.Coomer makes a pot of coffee at his home in Wagoner after a day of work at Walmart. \"As long as I sit down for about 10 minutes every hour or two, I'm fine,\" he says of working eight-hour shifts with the condition spinal stenosis. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b 'We were stunned' Employees at McDonnell Douglas in the early '90s enjoyed one of the more generous types of pensions, those known as \"30 and out.\" Employees with 30 years on the job could retire with a full pension once they reached age 55. But, as the employees would later learn, the generosity of those pensions made them, in lean times, an appealing target for cost-cutters. Those lean times for McDonnell Douglas began in earnest in the early '90s. Some plants closed. But for the remaining employees, including those at the Tulsa plant, executives said, there was hope: If Congress allowed the multibillion-dollar sale of 72 F-15s to Saudi Arabia, the new business would rescue the company. In fact, the company said in its 1991 annual report, it would save 7,000 jobs. To help win approval for the sale, Tulsa employees wrote letters to politicians. They held a rally with local politicians and the governor of Oklahoma. Eventually, in September 1992, President George H.W. Bush approved the sale. It seemed the Tulsa plant had weathered the storm. The headline in the Oklahoman, one of the state's largest newspapers, proclaimed: \"F-15 Sale to Saudi Arabia Saves Jobs of Tulsa Workers.\" But it hadn't. Within months, executives at the company again turned to cost-cutting. They considered closing a plant in Florida, another in Mesa, Ariz., or the Tulsa facility. Tulsa, it was noted, had the oldest hourly employees \u200a\u2014\u200a the average employee was 51 and had worked there for about 20 years. Many were close to getting a full pension, and that meant closing it would yield bigger savings in retirement costs. \"One day in December '93 they came on the loudspeaker and said, 'Attention, employees,' Coomer recalled. \"We were going to close. We were stunned. Just ran around like a bunch of chickens.\" A few years later, McDonnell Douglas, which continued to struggle, merged with Boeing. But the employees had taken their case to court, and in 2001, a federal judge agreed McDonnell Douglas had illegally considered the pensions in its decision to close the plant. The employees' case, presented by attorneys Joe Farris and Mike Mulder, showed the company had tracked pension savings in its plant closure decisions. The judge found McDonnell Douglas, moreover, had offered misleading testimony in its defense of the plant closing. The judge, Sven Erik Holmes, blasted the company for a \"corporate culture of mendacity.\" Employees eventually won settlements\u200a \u2014 \u200aabout $30,000 was typical. It helped carry people over to find new jobs. But the amount was limited to cover the benefits of three years of employment \u200a\u2014 \u200aand it was far less than the loss in pension and retiree health benefits. Because their pension benefits accrued most quickly near retirement age, the pensions they receive are only a small fraction of what they would have had they worked until full eligibility. \"People went to work at these places thinking they'll work there their whole lives,\" Farris said, noting that the pensions held great appeal to the staff. \"Their trust and loyalty, though, was not reciprocated.\"Ray walks through a collection of junk that he recycles at his home in Claremore. (Nick Oxford for The Washington Post) Source: The Washington Post \u200b Dreaming of work The economic effects were, of course, immediate. The workers, most of them over 50, had to find jobs. Some enrolled in classes for new skills, but then struggled to find jobs in their new fields. They wondered, amid rejections, whether younger workers were favored. Several found jobs at other industrial plants. One started a chicken farm for Tyson. Another took a job on a ranch breaking horses. The Post acquired a list of the 998 employees, reviewed public records for them and interviewed more than 25. Of those interviewed, all found work of one kind or another. Yet all but a handful said their new wages were only about half of what they had been making. Typically, their pay dropped in half, from about $20 per hour to $10 per hour. The pay cut was tough, and it made saving for retirement close to impossible. In fact, it has made retirement itself near impossible for some\u200a \u2014 \u200athey must work to pay the bills.

As a result of this ( and some bad luck ), the world's developed economies are over $70 trillion short on their pension obligations. This problem is still fixable. But before you can secure your own post-retirement future or help the world, it's important to understand why future pensioners may have to live in poverty. And to do that, we need to talk about the 3 problems listed above, starting with mismanagement. Mismanagement Most of Europe's large economies\u200a \u2014 \u200a Belgium , France , Germany and others\u200a \u2014 \u200ahave pay as you go pensions . This means collected from workers pays for current pension obligations instead of being saved for the future. This approach has its own downsides , but it does have an advantage. There are no pension funds , so there's nothing to mismanage . This protects EU pensioners from fund managers' mistakes. Of course, some EU countries and many US states have state pension funds. The ones that don't have private-owned ones . Both can be (and often are) mismanaged , losing their beneficiaries' money long before it's needed. Here's an example. Sweden's private pensions system used to let people invest with Maltese-based Falcon Fund . The latter defrauded 22,000 investors of over 2 billion Swedish kroner . That's an instance of fraud , which we'll get to in point 3 \u200a\u2014 \u200abut it couldn't have happened if Sweden's Pension Agency had a better vetting process. And that's mismanagement . Here's another example of mismanagement . In 1999, South Carolina's pension plans were 99% funded . However, the S.C. Retirement System Investment Commission performed so poorly the state's pensions are now $24 billion short . Meanwhile, the top 10 officials in the Investment Commission make an average of about $200,000 ; about 2x more than SC governor Nikki Haley. Scenarios like these are sad, but they're not uncommon. They point to consistent, systemic problems in how the world's economies deal with pensions. And the worst part is that governments and private funds may default on hundreds of millions of pensioners' debt obligations. Here's why. Broken Promises Pension money gets mismanaged often. They often end up short on money, even when fully funded \u200a\u2014\u200a and the issue is systemic. The US has a $4 trillion deficit in pension savings . The developed world as a whole is $78 trillion short. Meanwhile, the Gross World Product is only $78.28 trillion \u2014 \u200ameaning the deficit won't be easy to fix anytime soon. (Especially not with a rapidly aging world population). Now here's the problem. Most developed countries have pay as you go pensions ; something we explained above. In those countries, current workers \u200a\u2014\u200a who are also voters \u200a\u2014 \u200apay for retirees' pensions. What's to stop these taxpayers from electing to stop paying for older generations' pensions? You probably know the answer. Nothing. If the burden of pension payments gets too big, nothing stops workers from defaulting on old obligations. So far, most countries have managed to keep their pension systems running smoothly. But with a pension gap that's already comparable to the GDP (and growing), hundreds of millions of people may find themselves with absolutely no post-retirement security . Last but not least, let's talk about the third reason tomorrow's pensioners may live in poverty. Fraud Fraud is the last problem with pensions \u200a\u2014\u200a and it's more common than you may think. Just look at what happened to a few OECD countries' pension schemes in 2017\u20132018 . South Africa's government pension fund lost billions of rand by investing in the (apparently) fraudulent conglomerate, Steinhoff . Virginia's Attorney General is accusing BNY Mellon of defrauding Virginia's pension scheme of $20 million . And, in the Swedish pension fraud case above, it became clear that Falcon Fund was incapable of paying back the money it owed. And this is not to mention hundreds of instances of local , smaller-scale fraud and criminal mismanagement ! Now let's recap by listing the 3 key reasons pensioners may live in poverty by 2050: Fraud Mismanagement Broken promises The natural question is, can we do anything to change the situation \u200a\u2014 \u200aand can you avoid spending your golden years scrimping and saving? We believe so, which is why we're hard at work on a decentralized, blockchain-powered alternative to centralized pensions. With our solution, smart contracts and a sophisticated blockchain protocol would optimize pension funds' return rates while eliminating fraud.

The Mortgage Lender Implode-O-Meter caught on like wildfire with financial market voyeurs, regularly reaching 100,000 visitors. West Coast lenders, some may recall, were the first to fall in what eventually totaled 388 casualties. A year earlier, to much less fanfare, Jack Dean launched another website in anticipation of the different kind of wave washing up on the California coastline. Called the Pension Tsunami, the website was originally conceived to provide Golden State taxpayers with a one-stop resource to track news stories on the state's mammoth and numerous underfunded public pensions. Source: Bloomberg \u200b Dean came about his inspiration honestly: \"I started tracking this issue in 2004 after the Orange County Board of Supervisors gave a retroactive pension formula increase of 62 percent to county employees,\" he said. \"I was stunned. It's the main reason Orange County has a $4.5 billion underfunded liability today.\" As the years have passed, though, the site has become a font of information for states and municipalities nationwide as well as corporate pensions. In all, over 40,000 headlines have been posted to the website to date. On a recent Friday, Dean posted multiple stories on the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the country's largest pension program, as well as a budget cliff facing San Francisco, six Los Angeles public safety officers who collected over $1 million apiece last year in pensions, and eight cities that could face bankruptcy when the next recession hits. But the day's headlines also included the latest on the fiasco unfolding in Dallas , an update on Houston's less awful situation and features on states that have become the site's other usual suspects\u200a \u2014\u200a Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey. And that was a slow news day. The question is why haven't the headlines presaged pension implosions? As was the case with the subprime crisis, the writing appears to be on the wall. And yet calamity has yet to strike. How so? Call it the triumvirate of conspirators\u200a \u2014 \u200athe actuaries, accountants and their accomplices in office. Throw in the law of big numbers, very big numbers, and you get to a disaster in a seemingly permanent state of making. Unfunded pension obligations have risen to $1.9 trillion from $292 billion since 2007. Source: Bloomberg \u200b Credit rating firms have begun downgrading states and municipalities whose pensions risk overwhelming their budgets. New Jersey and the cities of Chicago, Houston and Dallas are some of the issuers in the crosshairs. Morgan Stanley says municipal bond issuance is down this year in part because of borrowers are wary of running up new debts to effectively service pensions. Source: Bloomberg \u200b Federal Reserve data show that in 1952, the average public pension had 96 percent of its portfolio invested in bonds and cash equivalents. Assets matched future liabilities. But a loosening of state laws in the 1980s opened the door to riskier investments. In 1992, fixed income and cash had fallen to an average of 47 percent of holdings. By 2016, these safe investments had declined to 27 percent. It's no coincidence that pensions' flight from safety has coincided with the drop in interest rates. That said, unlike their private peers, public pensions discount their liabilities using the rate of returns they assume their overall portfolio will generate. In fiscal 2016, which ended June 30th, the average return for public pensions was somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 percent. Corporations' accounting rules dictate the use of more realistic bond yields to discount their pensions' future liabilities. Put differently, companies have been forced to set aside something closer to what it will really cost to service their obligations as opposed to the fantasy figures allowed among public pensions. So why not just flip the switch and require truth and honesty in public pension math? Too many cities and potentially states would buckle under the weight of more realistic assumed rates of return. By some estimates, unfunded liabilities would triple to upwards of $6 trillion if the prevailing yields on Treasuries were used. That would translate into much steeper funding requirements at a time when budgets are already severely constrained. Pockets of the country would face essential public service budgets being slashed to dangerous levels. What's a pension to do? Increasingly, the answer is swing for the fences. Forget the fact that just under half of pension assets are in the second-most overvalued stock market in history. Even as Fed officials publicly fret about commercial real estate valuations, pensions have socked away eight percent of their portfolios into this less than liquid asset class. Even further out on the risk and liquidity spectrum is the 10 percent that pensions have allocated to private equity and limited partnerships. For the better part of a decade, New Albion Partners Chief Market Strategist Brian Reynolds has tracked pensions' allocations to these so-called alternative investments, and the total is approaching $350 billion. The working assumption is that the Pension Tsunami will never make land fall, but the next time you take comfort in the sanctity of pensions given they have yet to self-destruct, ask yourself instead how they are hedged in the event of a correction. Will it be their bond, stock, real estate or private equity holdings that shield their portfolios? Or will it be none of the above?

Source: ZeroHedge \u200b But, perhaps the most telling sign of the massive ponzi scheme being perpetrated on American retirees is the following chart which shows that net cash flows have become increasingly negative, as a percentage of assets, as annual cash benefit payments continue to exceed cash contributions.

Governments bail them out, or banks absorb their obligations. Business carries on as usual . This is a recurring pattern in the world economy. Pension plans fail, and someone steps in to save them. This is why the US has a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; why most EU governments fund pensions out of current taxes; why Brazil spends a whopping 11.3% of its GDP on pensions. It's that important that pensions get paid. And since pension schemes often find themselves broke or underfunded, 3rd parties intervene a lot. But what happens when pension schemes go broke and nobody steps in to save the day? What happens when pension schemes, funds and systems collapse permanently? In this 3-part series, we'll show you 5 real-life outcomes of complete pension scheme failure . In the first part, we'll look at a Stateside example: that of Prichard, Alabama . Prichard, Alabama Many people feel that living in an OECD country protects their pension. As you're about to see, they are wrong. The EU, the US and other developed countries can all leave retirees penniless. Here's one example. Prichard, Alabama, is a small town on the outskirts of Mobile, Alabama. Its pension fund was running out of money for years \u200a\u2014\u200a but the town's administration ignored all warnings. By 2009, Prichard's pension fund was 100% dry\u2026 So Prichard just stopped paying its 150+ retirees . This was in clear violation of state laws, but that didn't matter. Pensioners like Nettie Banks, a retired police and fire dispatcher, were left with no recourse to public funds. Other local stories were even more unfortunate. Police Captain Eddie Ragland was left unable to work after being badly wounded by a robber. Aged 59 and with no state pension, he had to rely on donations, bake sale proceeds and his neighbors to survive. Another Prichard pensioner\u200a \u2014 \u200athe retired fire marshal\u200a \u2014\u200a refused such help, and lived with no electricity or running water until found dead. The Prichard example shows that it doesn't matter where you live. The government isn't always going to step in to help. As a pensioner, you can find yourself poor in a heartbeat\u200a \u2014\u200a even if you live in a developed country where you worked as a state employee.

In this post, we'll look at 2 more examples of pension schemes that let retirees down. The first is\u2026 2. The National Bus Employees Superannuation Trust In the 80s, Margaret Thatcher's government was busy privatizing Britain's state-run services. One company they broke up and privatized was the National Bus Company , which had a particularly excellent employee pension plan. This NBS's pension plan was aptly called BEST: the Bus Employees' Superannuation Trust . Bus drivers and bus crews were often victims of assaults, violence, stress and more \u200a\u2014 \u200aso BEST was generous, and allowed for early retirement. As a result of this, the BEST fund had a sizeable surplus at the time it was privatized. The idea was for this surplus to improve retirees' pensions. To that end, BEST had an extra \u00a3168 million , paid by bus drivers and bus crews, to distribute among retirees. That's a lot of money\u200a \u2014 \u200abut what happened next was both unfortunate and criminal. Seeing the excess \u00a3168 million , the government decided to pocket it prior to privatization. It had undersold the National Bus Company by \u00a3300 million , so this was its way of making up some of the losses. Put more simply, the British government sold off a national company\u2026 But only after gutting its pension fund and taking \u00a3168 million from current and future pensioners. Now, to be fair, Margaret Thatcher's government only took the surplus money from BEST's beneficiaries. To be even more fair, a 13-year legal and political campaign did end in the Labour Government agreeing to return the money. But all of that is little consolation. The state had raided the BEST fund and gutted it on a whim. The National Bus Company employees had to rely on Britain's national pension\u200a \u2014 \u200aone of the worst-funded in the world\u200a \u2014\u200a instead. And that's the second time a major pension scheme collapsed, leaving millions worse off. Even developed states can and do take money from pensioners like Britain did in the above example. Things are even worse for underdeveloped states\u200a \u2014 \u200aas you're about to see in the next example. 3. How USSR's Pensioners Ended Up Penniless The USSR was a communist nation, meaning everyone worked for the state or a state-owned company \u200a\u2014\u200aand could count on a state pension after retirement. Unfortunately, the USSR dissolved in 1991 , leaving its successor state (Russia) to make good on its obligations. How did this go for Russia's pensioners? Well, after World War 2 , the USSR was the other superpower. You'd think that the people who helped build the state would enjoy some of its past prosperity \u200a\u2014 \u200aeven during an economic downturn. And you'd be wrong. By the time the USSR dissolved, inflation was running wild and national reserves were empty. There was no money to give state retirees. So around 1992\u20131993, the average Russian pensioner got 5\u201315 USD per month . By 1995 , the situation improved\u2026 With pensioners receiving 50 USD per month. Then came Russia's 1998 default when things got worse again, with pensions regressing to 19 USD. At the end of it all, tens of millions of pensioners were living below the poverty line. And this is not to mention that pensions often went unpaid, with the government's debt to pensioners standing at 17 trillion Russian Rubles by 1997 . By sheer magnitude, this is probably the biggest collapse on this list. USSR's workers had no choice but to work for the state. The state was their only source of post-retirement income. And in the end, it failed them completely and unexpectedly. In the next part of our post, we'll look at an ancient example of unpaid pensions, then go back to cover modern America's biggest collapsed private pension fund.

In this final part, we'll change things up by looking at a historical example of pension fund failure . We'll also cover what happens when a private company decides (or has no choice but) to stop paying pensions . 4. Ancient Rome Modern pensions are a new invention. However, past cultures \u200a\u2014 \u200aespecially warrior cultures\u200a \u2014 \u200aalso had pensions for soldiers . From Ancient Rome 's soldier-pensioners to Napoleon 's demi soldes , it's never been uncommon for soldier retirees to get governmental support. Just take Ancient Rome . From the 5th century BC, a soldier discharged honorably (with an honesta missio ) was entitled to several things, one of which was a pension . A full pension package included money, Roman citizenship and permission to marry a Roman ( conubium ). Together, these benefits became very enticing, and encouraged an ever-growing number of young men to serve. Unfortunately, the Roman empire eventually couldn't fund its pension obligations. Its currency devalued, inflation was high, and government pensions lost their luster. Thus collapsed the Roman national pension scheme\u200a \u2014\u200a leading, some believe, to the empire's ultimate demise. Last but not least, let's look at a different example. This case is unique, because pensioners were protected by their employer and the government\u2026 And lost their pension fund anyway. Here's how. 5. The United Airlines Bankruptcy The United States Government has guaranteed pensions since the 1970s . However, the United Airlines bankruptcy is an excellent example that government protection isn't everything \u2014 \u200aeven when coupled with working for a big corporation. Here's what happened. United Airlines declared bankruptcy in 2002 . The government bailed it out, but to make the numbers add up, UA had to default on many of its obligations. One of the things they defaulted on was over $9 bn of pension obligations . Usually, this wouldn't be possible, but the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation absorbed the obligations , albeit at a large discount. What this meant, in laymen's terms, was that over 130,000 UA employees were left with as little as 50% of the money they were promised. It didn't matter that they worked for a large corporation in a cash-rich industry. It didn't matter that the US government \"guarantees\" pensions. As with all the examples above, pensioners were left with far less than promised. And there you have it. Now you know how 5 major pension schemes \u200a\u2014 \u200afrom the Roman Empire's to United Airlines \u200a\u2014 \u200afailed, leaving millions destitute.

Many people, especially young people, find that they can't afford things that used to be consumer economy staple s \u200a\u2014 \u200aincluding home ownership . That's why an increasing number of young adults , from Japan's parasite singles to America's boomerang kids , is choosing to live with their parents to save money. But despite what some older people say, it's not that millennials are lazy and entitled. It's just that life is getting a lot more expensive than inflation tells us. Case in point: Helaine Olen 's book, Pound Foolish , shows that US families used to put 50% of their discretionary income towards housing, healthcare and education. In the 2000s , the respective figure was 75% , leaving just 25% for everything else. And it's not just the staples that are getting more expensive. From clothes to fast food to a drink at your favorite bar, things cost a lot more now than they did 5\u201310 years ago . In the first part of this 3-part series , we'll explain why this is happening. In parts 2 and 3, we'll focus on the truth about inflation, and look at how cars, clothes and homes are all significantly more expensive than they were for our parents. Let's start by going over the real, sometimes misleading, definition of inflation. What is Inflation, Really? The first order of business is to understand what inflation really is. Many people think that inflation measures how much a static basket of products changes in price over time\u200a \u2014 \u200a but this is wrong . In reality, inflation figures show how much the average household's spending changes year-on-year. In the US , these spending figures show up in the Customer Price Index . In the EU , they show up in the HCIP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) . But although the HCIP , CPI and other indices track a broad basket of items across different categories, they don't show us the specific products people are buying. This can mask a lot of inflation \u200a\u2014\u200a and here's how. Let's say it's 2018 and the entire state of Arizona buys bread for $1.20 . The brand they buy is called Arizona Bread and everyone loves it. But by this time next year, the price of Arizona Bread goes up to $1.50\u200a \u2014 \u200aso everyone switches to the cheaper (and less delicious) Oklahoma Loaf brand. Now, the way a regular consumer might look at it, bread just got 20% more expensive . But if you look at inflation figures , they might show you 0% inflation because the price of bread stayed the same. And that's what inflation is. A change in spending; not a change in the price of specific products. It's very important to understand this distinction, because the way inflation is calculated masks price shifts that make consumers switch to cheaper products. Unfortunately, this is just one of several reasons it's hard to gauge inflation accurately. In fact, for you and hundreds of millions of consumers, inflation can be drastically higher than statistics suggest. In the next part of this series, we'll explain why this is the case and take a look at 2 alternative inflation figures: the gold standard and the Big Mac index (yes, the Big Mac index). Then we'll move on to the real inflation figures for clothes, homes and more.

You can read all about it here \u2014 but the gist is this. Inflation doesn't track prices for products over time. It just tracks changes in household spending, without reflecting whether an individual product got more expensive or not. Here's how this can (and does) disguise real-life inflation. In the EU , wages have been falling for 10 years . The UK , Portugal , Greece , Hungary and other countries have seen theirs fall every year since 2009 . The EU's largest economies \u200a\u2014 \u200a France and Germany \u2014\u200a have been doing a little better, but have also seen wages fall consistently since 2014 . Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic , annual US wages have only risen once since 2009 \u200a \u2014\u200a and the middle class has lost 30% of its wealth. In short, median incomes have fallen . Because of this, consumers can't afford to spend more . As a result, household spending \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand inflation \u2014 \u200aare both highly stable . This is the first (and biggest) reason inflation isn't higher. The second reason is that consumer price indices are subjective, and change over time. For example, in 2005 , housing costs were weighted at about 25% \u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut that number has now risen to 40% . This means that homes are more expensive, but it also means consumer indices allot more money to housing costs, pushing down nominal inflation. In another example, the CPI weighs healthcare at just 8.6% when the US actually spends 18% of its GDP on medicine. This has a similar effect, reducing inflation figures while still leaving consumers with far less disposable income. So how far apart is nominal and real-life inflation? To get a realistic idea, let's look at 2 famous alternative price indices and their rate of inflation. 2 Alternative Price Indices In this section, we'll look at 2 alternative price indices . Unlike the USA's CPI and the EU's HCI P, these indices measure the price of 2 in-demand commodities: Big Macs and gold . This makes them more concrete, if less balanced, than the CPI and HCIP . We'll start with gold , which cost under $800 in Q3 2007 \u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200aand now costs over $1300 (after a short-term peak in 2011\u20132013). That's a 62.5% price difference, or an annualized 4.9% . That may not seem like much\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut when you compare it to the EU's official 1.5% or the US's 1.8%-2.1% , the difference is substantial. Now, you could argue that gold is an important commodity\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut a poor way to measure price changes over time. And that's a fair point, so let's look at our second index: that of the Big Mac . In 2012 , a stateside Big Ma c cost $4.33 . A French Big Mac cost $4.36 . 6 years later (2017) , these prices rose to $5.3 and $5.1 respectively. That's an annual Big Mac inflation rate of 4.1% for the US and 3.2% for the EU : nothing criminal, but far from official inflation rates . Again, these two indices are very subjective. But if both a fast food staple and gold are appreciating faster than inflation suggests, who's to say the same isn't happening for other assets and commodities? That's right. Nobody . Looking at these numbers, it's a little hard to believe that inflation is as low as OECD governments say it is\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200abut that's not all. In researching this article, we found that other (less common) goods and * services *may have appreciated far more than all the above numbers suggest. That might sound hyperbolic , but stay tuned for the next (and last) part of this series. We'll take a look at how much schools , cars and homes have appreciated in recent years\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200a and you may be surprised at the figures you see.

This time, we're going to look at specific examples of goods and services appreciating a lot faster than we think. Specifically, we'll look at cars , homes , education and clothes , all of which have gotten a lot more expensive in the last decade. First on our list are\u2026 Clothes In the last couple of decades , we've seen a boom of \"fast fashion\" brands like Zara , H&M and Topshop . Anecdotally, shoppers know that as recently as 5\u20137 years ago, it was difficult to find an item priced at $100 in any of these brands' offerings. Today, though, fast fashion price points of $100 , $200 and $300 are all common. In other words, fast fashion quickly went from a cheap alternative to high-end brands to being fairly expensive . And if you look at other fashion segments, you'll see a similar change . Next up, let's look at cars . Cars In the late 20th century US , a car was a staple rather than a luxury . Anecdotally, most median-income households could buy a car by sticking to the 20/4/10 rule : 20% of your income on a down payment, then 10% of your income to pay for interest and insurance over 4 years. Today, things are very different. Using the 20/4/10 rule, a median Miami resident has $13,577 to buy a car. For comparison, the average new car actually costs $35,368 . That's a big gap, and it shows that new cars\u200a \u2014\u200a heck, all cars \u200a\u2014 \u200aare now out of reach for the median American . (In other countries, where cars tend to be more expensive, things are often worse, with cars being completely out of the question for many families.) Now let's move on to another important cost: that of owning or renting a home. Homes In much of the developed world , homes have never been more expensive . A 1940 home would cost the average American family $2,938 . Adjusted for inflation, that's under $40,000 in today's dollars. But today, an actual U.S. home costs well over $200,000 ; a 500% difference after you adjust for inflation . Clearly, homes are far more expensive than inflation numbers suggest. A similar pattern emerges in Europe . In countries like Italy , France and Spain , the house price:disposable income ratio has gone up by 50% or more in the last 2 decades . Europeans have never paid so much for homes; same as Americans. Last but not least, let's talk about\u2026 Education In the United States , college fees have appreciated 4x faster than the CPI since the 1940s . This means that, once again, inflation figures don't capture the extent to which education has become more expensive. In Europe , things are a little better. Nordic countries and welfare states like Belgium and France still offer education for relatively little money. But in other countries, fees can go up very quickly (and unexpectedly). Case in point: the UK famously tripled university fees in 2013\u20132014 , and Ireland's university fees are currently in line with the US's . In short, education is getting more expensive on both sides of the ocean\u200a\u2014\u200aand at a far greater speed than inflation figures suggest. And there you have it. Although official inflation figures are low, everything is getting more expensive\u200a\u2014\u200aand fast.

A blockchain is a data storage approach that can be described as a growing list (or ledger) of records that are stored in blocks which are linked using cryptography. Reading data from the blockchain is permissionless and open for everyone while the creation of a new block is controlled by decentralized consensus. At the moment, there are many consensus algorithms under investigation but only two are really used in practice by major blockchain networks: Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). A Proof-of-work algorithm was originally developed for e-mail spam protection project Hashcash , but the only launch of the Bitcoin network brought this concept to a wide public. The key idea of PoW is probabilistic right to creation of a new block based on a share of contributed computational work that can be easily verified. Such a principle enables competition of workers (or miners) for block creation and ensures network by economic mechanism: for attacking the network malefactor have to buy a huge amount of computational facilities that are expensive (and expensiveness of necessary amount of hardware is correlated with the total network hash power). The Proof-of-Stake idea is based on a simple competition of coin holders for block creation: more coins are on a wallet balance, the bigger is probability to create a new block. If someone wants to attack the network, he needs to buy a lot of coins what is expensive (and the cost is correlated with the network capitalization). By the way, what is motivation to attack a network in which you are the whale and own a lot of coins? :) With blockchain technology, there is no centralized entity that controls everything. The decentralization gives it a number of unique properties that are not inherent to other data storage approaches. These include resistance to data modification, the ability to operate in an entirely untrusted environment, and a high level of security and privacy. They allow the creation of different p2p networks and completely new business models that were impossible to imagine before. The biggest and oldest blockchain network is well-known Bitcoin. The famous p2p \u201celectronic cash\u201d system, as it was defined by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto, helps people all over the world to transfer from $1 bln to $2 bln in assets daily safely, reliably and independent from any third parties such as banks and government structures. Further important applications of blockchain technology beyond the transfer of value are decentralized finance (DeFi), distributed computing, and different social applications. Projects based on blockchain technology allows people to use services previously offered only by centralized corporations with a completely new user experience such as high levels of data privacy, reliability, and safety from third-party actions. Such projects form a new layer of the internet known as web3 , which \u2013 as opposed to web2 \u2013 is focused on the needs of end-users, not corporations. What is crypto? The \u201cCrypto\u201d term was initially invented to specify a new type of currencies whose issuance and operation are based on blockchain technology and protected by cryptography. Lately, \u201ccrypto\u201d or the \u201ccrypto industry\u201d have become synonymous to the \u201cblockchain industry.\u201d The history of crypto began on 31 October 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper . Several months later, the first Bitcoin block was mined, and the network started growing. During the first five years of network operation, Bitcoin survived a lot of ups and downs of its price, a hack of the major exchange \u2013 Mt.Gox \u2013 and attracted millions of enthusiasts that started to support the growing industry in different ways such as development, mining and spreading the information. More recently, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood introduced Ethereum , a distributed computer and operating system that supports smart-contracts and, therefore, allows to build a variety of new applications that are not limited to p2p payments like Bitcoin. It also enabled the creation of a new asset class \u2013 tokens. Tokens are digital assets, issued on a blockchain. Tokens can be stores of value but also enable vital services and governance within blockchain projects while not requiring their own, native blockchain protocol. The most popular standard for token issuing at the present moment is Ethereum-based ERC20 , used by the majority of decentralized applications (dApps) nowadays. Furthermore, there are other popular cryptocurrencies that include Litecoin (LTC), launched in 2011 as a Bitcoin fork, Monero, EOS, Dash and many others. By 2017, the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies went through a hype period that resulted in a large speculative bubble, which burst in subsequent months and led to stark price drops in 2018-2019. Nevertheless, during the 2017-2019 period, the blockchain industry made a significant step forward and now is presented by dozens of projects that are successfully operating and serving customers at different markets, such as finance, gambling, advertising, and social networks. At the present moment, in the middle of 2019, the crypto industry is boiling up with new projects promising to transform more industries. They are building the foundation and first applications of a new digital world: one based on user-centered business models and a new level of people cooperation.

The Internet allowed people to seamlessly communicate and produce something together regardless of their location and, therefore, significantly increased the efficiency of human collaboration. It led to widespread digital communities that pursue shared goals and often manage collectively owned resources. One of the most daunting problems these communities faced is governance. The management of a community distributed worldwide is not an easy task, especially taking into account the absence of legal frameworks and possible mutual mistrust between members who never meet in person and can hide behind nicknames. There is also a well known problem of irrational public usage of the common resources, known as the tragedy of commons. Blockchain technology allowed the development of governance frameworks for digital communities which are based on the principle \u201cthe code is law\u201d and can successfully operate in an entirely trustless environment. The \u201ccode as law\u201d approach leads to the automatization of the management of digital communities and ensures that all decisions and actions will be done on the basis of the defined ruleset and in the interests of the majority. Currently, such blockchain-based organizations that are represented by computer code and not influenced by a central government are defined as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The main features of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) are: \u2022 A fully-digital organization, whose operation is based on blockchain technology and defined by a set of smart-contracts \u2022 Non-hierarchical organization \u2022 Decisions are made by a collective decision-making process based on the voting of members \u2022 Shareholders are represented by an autonomous network of DAO token holders \u2022 The value created within the DAO is distributed among all members \u2022 High levels of transparency and privacy: individuals control their identity and personal data A brief history of the concept The DAO concept was first proposed by Daniel Larimer in 2013 in his article devoted to the idea of Decentralized Autonomous Corporations for use in Bitshares. The founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, discussed the DAO concept and its variations in 2014 before the Ethereum network was launched. The DASH network became the first live DAO in 2015 by implementing a shared finance pool for ecosystem development, with allocation managed by owners of master nodes. The first large-scale DAO experiment started in May 2016, called \u201cThe DAO\u201d project. It collected $150 mln in ether during crowdfunding and set a new world crowdfunding record. However, an attack on the DAO on 17 June led to the theft of 3.6 mln of ether by an anonymous hacker. It prompted an Ethereum hardfork to return the stolen money to investors. Besides The DAO, in 2016 another DAO project was launched - DigixDAO, which is still successfully operating nowadays. During the explosive growth of the blockchain industry in 2017-2018, numerous DAO projects were developed, most notable are Aragon, DAOStack and MakerDAO. Examples of successful DAO projects \u2022 DigixDAO - the DAO launched in 2016, which aims to provide an opportunity for Ethereum users to use a gold-backed stablecoin; \u2022 Aragon - a platform that provides a service for creating new DAOs for Ethereum users; \u2022 DAOStack - a platform that is positioned as an \u201coperating system for collective intelligence\u201d and allows to create digital organizations and funds; \u2022 DASH - a digital currency whose main features are fast transactions and a special coin mixing service that improves transaction anonymity.

The informal economy can be defined as the set of economic activities, such as businesses or jobs, that are not regulated or protected by the state. The term originally applied to unregistered self-employment and small enterprises. Today, the informal economy sector includes remittances, mutual savings, and investment activity, as well as any kind of unregistered business or goods production. It includes more than 60% of the global workforce and 90% of micro and small enterprises (MSEs). The phenomenon is common both in developed and developing countries, with a tendency to take a more significant share in developing countries. Generally, a lower level of economic opportunity and state stability leads more citizens to take care of their money, jobs, and businesses by themselves. In South Asia, approximately 80-90% of the workforce is employed in the informal sector; for example, in Bangladesh, this indicator is ~89% based on results of research published by the Asian Development Bank. In the majority of African countries, the situation is pretty similar . People are not only using the informal sector for jobs and businesses, but also for basic financial needs such as savings. One intriguing phenomenon of the informal economy is the formation of informal savings groups, which exist in 73 countries across the globe. Informal savings groups play a crucial role in the daily life of people from certain countries of Africa, South Asia, and South America. In the presence of an unstable banking system and untrusted and corrupted government, people prefer to take care of all financial activities by themselves and rely only on services based on social trust. These structural problems are relatively widespread in developing countries. The most studied region where savings groups are widely used is the sub-Saharan region of Africa. For example, in Kenya savings groups are called \u201cChamas\u201d, which means \u201cgroup\u201d or \u201cbody\u201d in Kiswahili, the national language. A Chama is an offline cooperative group of 15-25 members created for collective savings and investments and based only on social trust. \u201cChamas\u201d are widespread - only in Kenya, there are more than 300,000 Chamas holding more than $3.5 bln in assets. In different countries, informal savings groups have their own local names but the core principles are the same. Individuals put their savings together and invest jointly in projects, lend out money to members, and collectively manage the funds. The groups often come together around one goal, such as saving to acquire land or production inputs, and they promote financial discipline and mutual support mechanisms. Members tend to point out the outstanding stability and effectiveness of such social organizations. In the Akropolis network, the broader term \u201cautonomous financial organization\u201d (AFO) is used to incorporate savings groups and other forms of collective financial organizations. We are trying to provide a flexible and seamlessly customizable solution that can be used by savings groups, cooperatives and other forms of mutual community-based organizations all over the world. An autonomous financial organization (AFO) is a self-sovereign, digital, member-owned organization that provides financial services such as co-saving and co-investing, access to credit on flexible terms, and a basic form of insurance. The AFO concept covers not only informal savings groups in developing countries but also other types of cooperative organizations used in such countries like the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. Common examples are mutuals (UK, Germany), Broodfonds (Netherlands) and cooperatives. One of our goals is to empower the informal economy by offering a secure and reliable digital platform that will support the majority of known forms of informal organizations to function more smoothly and interact.","title":"Round 4"},{"location":"old/quest/round4/#round-4","text":"","title":"Round 4"},{"location":"old/quest/round4/#what-is-the-informal-economy","text":"The informal economy can be defined as the set of economic activities, such as businesses or jobs, that are not regulated or protected by the state. The term originally applied to unregistered self-employment and small enterprises. Today, the informal economy sector includes remittances, mutual savings, and investment activity, as well as any kind of unregistered business or goods production. It includes more than 60% of the global workforce and 90% of micro and small enterprises (MSEs). The phenomenon is common both in developed and developing countries, with a tendency to take a more significant share in developing countries. Generally, a lower level of economic opportunity and state stability leads more citizens to take care of their money, jobs, and businesses by themselves. In South Asia, approximately 80-90% of the workforce is employed in the informal sector; for example, in Bangladesh, this indicator is ~89% based on results of research published by the Asian Development Bank. In the majority of African countries, the situation is pretty similar . People are not only using the informal sector for jobs and businesses, but also for basic financial needs such as savings. One intriguing phenomenon of the informal economy is the formation of informal savings groups, which exist in 73 countries across the globe. Informal savings groups play a crucial role in the daily life of people from certain countries of Africa, South Asia, and South America.

The global economy is on the verge of another global financial crisis with the global pensions deficit, meaning the total outstanding pensions liabilities to people, including all asset classes, currently at $78 trillion. It is expected to reach four times global GDP by 2050. Government debts are rising year per year. In the USA alone, the national debt is over $22 trillion up to date. However, according to some estimates, the fiscal gap may be up to ten times greater. Total world debt is estimated to be as high as $244 trillion. In a situation where many existing institutions face bankruptcy and collapse, it is worthwhile to look at how people have previously shown resilience to instability and uncertainty. More precisely, we look at the ways people have used to protect each other and maintain a social contract to preserve and multiply their wealth before the existence of modern-day financial institutions. The answer lies in self-sovereignty through the ability to protect one's savings and in growth through trust-based communities as a source of support, informal credit, and emergency social insurance. The concept of self-governed social groups which run finance and social insurance services for its members is already used at scale in countries with an unstable economy, such as many developing countries, and has proved its efficiency and reliability in protecting members from ruin. We believe that the future of finance belongs to user-owned networks.

A DPO (Direct Premium Offering) is a fundraising approach based on offering tokens of a project to contributors on a cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange performs the whole fundraising cycle. Individuals interested in acquiring the token in its initial offering go through the exchange and can trade the token immediately thereafter. In order to mitigate periods of extreme volatility when the market opens, and to reduce the risk of adverse impacts on investors, there is a period of tiered price limits. The concept is similar to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) but includes the immediate listing of the token, thus much more closely mirroring Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on traditional stock exchanges. It presents the next iteration in crypto\u2019s journey to offer reliable crowdfunding mechanisms for promising projects. More information about the details of the DPO process can be found here . A brief history of crowdfunding options. Crowdfunding through the internet became a popular and powerful new fundraising options through centralized platforms such as famous Kickstarter.com. Kickstarter and similar services allowed people from all over the world to offer new ideas and products, raise money for product development, or invest money in something promising. The approach unlocked the potential of the internet\u2019s broad accessibility to create a financial P2P application that offered new opportunities outside ordinary banking credit or VC funding. It allowed the flourishing of a variety of new physical products and digital services. More recently, blockchain technology enabled a more decentralized fundraising process, leading to the appearance of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) concept. An ICO features community contributions in cryptocurrency to a project that is seeking funding in exchange for the native token used in the new project. The main advantages of ICOs are the possibility to contribute or attract funds from all over the world without barriers (although, from the legal side, there are significant restrictions in some jurisdictions like the USA), trade tokens whose value is linked to the project development after the ICO and fund projects that cannot be funded in other ways. The first project funded using ICO approach was Mastercoin , which was re-branded to OmniLayer , a protocol for Tether USD (USDT) issuance and operation. Several of the most notable projects in the industry, including Ethereum, EOS, and Binance were funded using ICOs. According to icodata statistics, during 2017 and 2018, ICO projects collected more than $14 bln. However, the ICO process also has a lot of drawbacks: a big percentage of fraudulent projects, a mess in regulation that sometimes results in offering unregistered securities to retail investors, and the absence of trusted due diligence and project scoring. At the present moment, ICOs have fallen out of favor as a trusted and reliable funding approach. In response to the fall of ICOs, the Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) emerged as a new favorite in the industry to conduct crowdfunding for promising projects. A key upside is that an exchange acts as the due diligence agent, doing their own research on projects, and selecting only the ones they trust. An IEO is also more convenient for contributors as they can use funds from their deposits at the exchange for contribution and be sure that token will be listed in a short time. For projects, it is a possibility to focus on project development while a significant share of fundraising activities will be carried out by an exchange. Thus, it is a more effective and safe fundraising approach for all parties in comparison with ICO.","title":"Round 6"},{"location":"old/quest/round6/#round-6","text":"","title":"Round 6"},{"location":"old/quest/round6/#what-is-dpo-or-prime-offering","text":"A DPO (Direct Premium Offering) is a fundraising approach based on offering tokens of a project to contributors on a cryptocurrency exchange.

To solve this issue several blockchain interoperability projects were started back in 2017-2019 wherein Polkadot plays an important role. Founded by Gavin Wood, the Ethereum co-founder, Polkadot is based on the concept of \u201cheterogeneous sharded multichain\u201d and aimed to create \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d. The \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d is an ecosystem where blockchains can seamlessly exchange value and information. The existence of such a system would allow creating a big variety of blockchain applications that will be able to work with assets and smart contracts based on different chains. This opens up tremendous opportunities for building financial, social and other applications that will be trustless, privacy-oriented and secure. Based on this, the Akropolis team chose to build a product on top of Polkadot along with more than twenty blockchain teams, developing completely different services. So, what will be next?

Founded by Gavin Wood, the Ethereum co-founder, Polkadot is based on the concept of \u201cheterogeneous sharded multichain\u201d and aimed to create \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d. The \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d is an ecosystem where blockchains can seamlessly exchange value and information. The existence of such a system would allow creating a big variety of blockchain applications that will be able to work with assets and smart contracts based on different chains. This opens up tremendous opportunities for building financial, social and other applications that will be trustless, privacy-oriented and secure. Based on this, the Akropolis team chose to build a product on top of Polkadot along with more than twenty blockchain teams, developing completely different services. So, what will be next? Your imagination is the only frontier as things really change very fast. We cannot see the future but we can look at the past to find the most prominent people, ideas and products developed by them.
